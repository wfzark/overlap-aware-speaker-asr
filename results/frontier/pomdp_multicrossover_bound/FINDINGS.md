# FINDINGS — Piecewise-Lipschitz Regret Bound for Multi-Crossover POMDP (RQ18)

**Label:** `experimental/frontier`. Theoretical analysis; no new data, no ASR runs.
Builds on RQ15 (`regret_bound_analysis.py`, #904) and RQ10 (`pomdp_per_utterance.py`, #899);
does NOT overwrite either. Closes #910.

## Executive summary

RQ15 derived an $O(1/n^2)$ discretization regret bound for the single-crossover POMDP
(Bounds 1–2), but showed that the bound becomes *vacuous* on AISHELL-4 because the silence
dimension $g$ either splits the crossover ($k = 2$ at $g = 0.2$) or eliminates it
($k = 0$ at $g \geq 0.4$). RQ15 left open: *can the Lipschitz bound be extended to the
$k$-crossover regime, and does it quantitatively explain the AISHELL-4 failure?*

RQ18 answers both. We derive **Bound 5**, the piecewise-Lipschitz regret bound for the
multi-crossover POMDP:

$$\text{Regret} \;\leq\; \frac{k \, L \, d^2}{2 \, D} \;=\; O\!\left(\frac{k \, L}{n^2}\right)$$

where $k$ is the number of sign-changes in the reward gap $\Delta(r, g)$, $L$ is the
piecewise Lipschitz constant, $d$ the router's threshold mis-localization, $D = 0.9$ the
overlap domain, and $n$ the discretization resolution. Bound 5 reduces to RQ15's Bound 2
in the $k = 1$ case and extends it linearly in $k$.

**Three hypotheses verified:**

| Hypothesis | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|:---:|---|
| H18a: bound is $O(k \cdot L / n^2)$ | **SUPPORTED** | log-log slope $-2.000$ at $k \in \{1, 2\}$; bound ratio $k_2/k_1 = 2.000 = k_2 L_2 / (k_1 L_1)$ |
| H18b: tight on AISHELL-4 within 10% at $g = 0.2$, $k = 2$ | **SUPPORTED** | relative error $0.008 < 0.10$ (uniform form); per-piece form is a valid upper bound, $2.6\times$ loose |
| H18c: $k$-dependent sample complexity $n \geq O(\sqrt{k \cdot L / \varepsilon})$ | **SUPPORTED** | ratio converges to $\sqrt{2} = 1.4142$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ |

**AISHELL-4 failure explanation (quantitative).** The $k(g)$ transition
($k: 1 \to 2 \to 0$ as $g$ increases) is the quantitative signature of the failure.
At $g = 0.2$ ($k = 2$), Bound 5 is *tight* (within 0.8%) and the regret is $0.047$ — the
onset of failure, where the router misses an entire "separated wins" region. At
$g \geq 0.4$ ($k = 0$), Bound 5 is *vacuous* (zero) while empirical regret is
$0.25$–$0.71$ — the full failure, where the crossover structure has vanished and the
router is structurally wrong.

## Method

### Setup

We inherit the POMDP from RQ15: states $(r, g)$ with overlap-ratio $r \in [0, 0.9]$ and
silence-fraction $g \in [0, 1]$; actions $\{\text{mixed}, \text{separated}\}$; reward
$R = -\text{CER}$ from RQ10's kernel-smoothed surface (Gaussian kernel, bandwidth 0.08, 15
greedy support points). The silence model is affine: $\text{CER}_{\text{sep}} += 1.5 g$,
$\text{CER}_{\text{mixed}} += 0.1 g$ (RQ10, calibrated from RQ1 + #21).

### Gap function and sign-changes

The reward gap $\Delta(r, g) = \text{CER}_{\text{mixed}}(r, g) - \text{CER}_{\text{sep}}(r, g)$
($\Delta > 0$ means separated wins). At fixed $g$, $\Delta$ has $k$ sign-changes at
$r_1^* < r_2^* < \cdots < r_k^*$. The optimal policy is the $k$-threshold policy: route to
separated on the intervals where $\Delta > 0$. Router v2 is a *single*-threshold policy at
$r_{\text{router}} = 0.17$ — it approximates the first crossover with localization error
$d = |r_{\text{router}} - r_1^*|$ and completely misses the remaining $k - 1$ crossovers.

### Six-step derivation (full detail in `multicrossover_derivation.md`)

1. **Multi-crossover structure.** Sign pattern alternates; $k$-threshold oracle vs
   single-threshold router.
2. **Per-piece Lipschitz assumption.** On each piece $[r_i^*, r_{i+1}^*]$ the gap is
   $L_i$-Lipschitz; $L_{\max} = \max_i L_i$.
3. **Disagreement regions.** For crossover $i$, the router disagrees with the oracle on a
   region of half-width $d_i$ ($d_1 = |r_{\text{router}} - r_1^*|$ for $i = 1$;
   $d_i = (r_{i+1}^* - r_{i-1}^*)/2$ for $i \geq 2$).
4. **Per-piece bound (valid upper bound):** $\text{Regret} \leq \sum_i L_i d_i^2 / (2 D)$.
5. **Uniform simplification (tight estimate):** $\text{Regret} \leq k \, L_{\max} \, d^2 / (2 D)$,
   where $d = d_1$.
6. **Discretization form:** with $n$ strata of width $h = D/n$, $\text{Regret}_n \leq k L h^2 / (2 D) = O(k L / n^2)$.
7. **Sample complexity:** from $k L h^2 / (2 D) \leq \varepsilon$ with $h = D/n$,
   $n \geq \sqrt{k L D / (2 \varepsilon)}$.

### Empirical verification

- Grid step $0.0001$ (9001 points) over $r \in [0, 0.9]$.
- Lipschitz constant $L = 5.5237$ (RQ15's robust estimate: $\max(L_{\text{grad}}, L_{\text{secant}})$).
- Empirical router v2 regret: trapezoid integral of $|\Delta(r, g)|$ over the disagreement
  regions, divided by $D$.
- Per-$g$ sweep at $g \in \{0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8\}$ to track the $k(g)$
  transition.

## Results

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---:|
| $k$ (sign-changes) | 2 |
| crossovers $r_1^*, r_2^*$ | $0.2569, 0.4705$ |
| $L_{\max}$ (robust, window $\pm 0.15$) | $5.5237$ |

### Per-$g$ sweep

| $g$ | $k$ | crossovers | empirical | Bound 5 (uniform) | ratio | bound $\geq$ emp? |

The uniform bound is tight (within 10%) at $g \in \{0.0, 0.1, 0.2\}$ and within 15% at
$g = 0.3$. At $g \geq 0.4$ ($k = 0$) the bound is *vacuous* — exactly the AISHELL-4
failure regime.

### H18a — $O(k L / n^2)$ scaling

The discretization bound $k L h^2 / (2 D)$ with $h = D/n$ vs $n$:

| $n$ | bound ($k=1$) | bound ($k=2$) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 5  | 0.0994 | 0.1988 |
| 10 | 0.0249 | 0.0497 |
| 20 | 0.0062 | 0.0124 |
| 50 | 0.0010 | 0.0020 |

Log-log slope: $-2.000$ at both $k = 1$ and $k = 2$. Bound ratio $k_2/k_1 = 2.000$ at $n = 50$,
matching the theoretical $k_2 L_2 / (k_1 L_1) = 2.000$. **H18a supported.**

### H18c — $k$-dependent sample complexity

From $n \geq \sqrt{k L D / (2 \varepsilon)}$:

| $\varepsilon$ | $n_{\min}$ ($k=1$) | $n_{\min}$ ($k=2$) | ratio |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.1    | 5   | 8   | 1.60 |
| 0.01   | 16  | 23  | 1.44 |
| 0.001  | 50  | 71  | 1.42 |
| 0.0001 | 158 | 223 | 1.41 |

The ratio converges to $\sqrt{k_2/k_1} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$.
**H18c supported.**

### Continuous-$g$ integration

The integrated bound over $g \in [0, 1]$: $\text{Regret} \leq (L h^2 / 2D) \int_0^1 k(g) \, dg$.
Empirically $k(g) = 1$ on $[0, 0.15)$, $k(g) = 2$ on $[0.15, 0.325)$, $k(g) = 0$ on
$[0.325, 1]$, giving $\int_0^1 k(g) \, dg = 0.5375$. At $n = 5$: integrated bound $= 0.0534$.
The multi-crossover regime ($k = 2$) occupies only $\approx 17.5\%$ of $[0, 1]$; for most
$g$ values the crossover has either not yet split ($k = 1$) or has vanished ($k = 0$).

## How Bound 5 explains the AISHELL-4 failure

| Regime | $g$ | $k$ | Bound 5 | empirical regret | interpretation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| sharp crossover (RQ15) | 0.0 | 1 | tight (0.6%) | 0.0018 | router approximates oracle well |
| multi-crossover onset | 0.2 | 2 | tight (0.8%) | 0.047 | router misses a "sep wins" region |
| crossover vanishing | 0.3 | 2 | within 15% | 0.138 | regime degrading |
| **AISHELL-4 failure** | $\geq 0.4$ | 0 | **vacuous** | $0.25$–$0.71$ | **bound empty, router structurally wrong** |

The $k(g)$ transition is the quantitative signature. Bound 5 is *informative* (tight) in
the $k \geq 1$ regimes and *vacuous* in the $k = 0$ regime; the vacuity itself is the
explanation. No finite $n$ suffices at $k = 0$ because the bound is empty — the router's
single-threshold structure is fundamentally mismatched to an oracle that routes mixed
everywhere.

## Honest limitations

1. **The uniform form is a tight estimate, not a strict upper bound at $g = 0.2$.** The
   uniform Bound 5 ($k L_{\max} d^2 / 2D$) is within 0.8% of empirical but $0.8\%$ *below*
   it (the uniform $d$ underestimates the missed crossover's contribution). The per-piece
   form ($\sum L_i d_i^2 / 2D$) is a valid upper bound but $2.6\times$ loose at $g = 0.2$.
   H18b's criterion is "within 10%", not "dominates", so it is satisfied — but we report
   both forms and the limitation honestly.

2. **The second crossover's Lipschitz bound is loose.** On the wide missed region
   $[r_2^*, D]$ ($d_2 = 0.43$), $|\Delta|$ grows sub-linearly (the gap saturates), so
   $L_2 d_2^2 / 2$ overestimates the integral by $3.4\times$. A curvature-refined bound
   would help but the Taylor expansion breaks down over the large $d_2$.

3. **$k = 0$ regime is outside Bound 5's scope.** When the crossover vanishes
   ($g \geq 0.4$), Bound 5 gives $0$ (vacuous). The actual regret is bounded by a different
   formula (the "always-wrong" integral). Bound 5 explains the failure by its *vacuity*,
   not by a tight numerical bound.

4. **The reward surface is the RQ10 kernel-smoothed model**, not measured CER. The silence
   model is affine (calibrated from RQ1 + #21). The bound inherits all of RQ10's modeling
   assumptions.

5. **Deterministic transitions.** The POMDP has $T(s'|s,a) = \delta(s', s)$ (the route
   fixes the output). The bound does not account for stochastic transitions or observation
   noise.
