# RQ1: AISHELL-4 External Validation of Overlap-Aware Router v2

> **Label: `external/sanity-check`** — first external benchmark validation of the router v2 routing policy.
> Does NOT overwrite verified gold references or gold result tables.
> Closes #881. See `RESEARCH/overlap-aware-speaker-asr/framing/research_question.md` (RQ1),
> `framing/hypothesis.md` (H1a, H1b), `framing/gap_analysis.md` (Gap M1).

## Executive Summary

The overlap-aware router v2 was validated on a real AISHELL-4 meeting (M_R003S02C01, 38.5 min, 6 speakers, 77 windows of 30s each) with cpWER evaluation via MeetEval. This is the first external benchmark test of the project's central routing thesis ("when should we separate?").

**H1a (router v2 beats always-mixed): NOT SUPPORTED.** Router v2 cpWER (1.206) is slightly worse than always-mixed (1.173); the paired bootstrap 95% CI [-0.152, +0.186] crosses zero. The router's NoOverlap rule (choose separated when the mixed transcript is long) does not transfer to AISHELL-4 because oracle-separated tracks with TextGrid boundaries carry silence that triggers Whisper hallucination, making separated worse than mixed even at NoOverlap.

**H1b (mixed < separated at low overlap): SUPPORTED, and stronger than expected.** Mixed ASR achieves lower cpWER than separated ASR at ALL overlap levels (NoOverlap Δ=+0.20, LightOverlap Δ=+0.64, MidOverlap Δ=+0.72), not just low overlap. The separation tax is more severe on real meeting audio than on the 5-case gold benchmark, where separated was better at HeavyOverlap. This is the most important external finding: the gold-baseline routing boundary (separated wins at high overlap) does NOT transfer to AISHELL-4 under oracle TextGrid separation + Whisper-tiny.

**Preprocessing:**
- Audio: FLAC → 16 kHz mono WAV via ffmpeg.
- Reference: TextGrid parsed to extract per-speaker intervals (start, end, text). TextGrid escape sequences (`<%>`, `<sil>`, `<#>`) stripped.
- Separation: **oracle** — per-speaker audio tracks created by zeroing all non-speaker regions within each 30 s window using TextGrid boundaries. This is the same "oracle separation" paradigm as the gold benchmark (not a real separator like SepFormer; see Gap M2).
- No audio files are committed to the repository (gitignored); only the validation script and results JSON are committed.

## Experimental Setup

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| ASR model | Whisper-tiny (CPU, FP32) |
| Language | zh (Chinese) |
| Window size | 30 s |
| Number of windows | 77 (full meeting) |
| Mixed condition | Whisper on the full 30 s meeting audio |
| Separated condition | Whisper on each speaker's oracle track (speech at original positions, silence elsewhere), per-speaker text concatenated |
| cpWER (separated) | MeetEval `cpwer` — N hypothesis speakers vs N reference speakers, minimum permutation |
| orcWER (mixed) | MeetEval `orcwer` — 1 hypothesis stream vs N reference speakers, optimal reference combination |
| Router v2 | `src/adaptive_router_v2.py` `choose_method_v2()` — reference-free (overlap_level + text_length_ratio + runtime_ratio + mixed_segments_count; NO CER used as input) |
| Overlap ratio | Fraction of 30 s window where ≥2 speakers are active (computed from TextGrid) |
| Overlap level mapping | 0=NoOverlap (<0.05), 1=LightOverlap (0.05–0.2), 2=MidOverlap (0.2–0.5), 3=HeavyOverlap (≥0.5) |
| Statistical test | Paired bootstrap CI (10,000 resamples, seed=42) |

**Overlap distribution of the 77 windows:**

| Level | Count | Fraction |
|-------|------:|---------:|
| NoOverlap | 41 | 53% |
| LightOverlap | 24 | 31% |
| MidOverlap | 11 | 14% |
| HeavyOverlap | 1 | 1% |

This meeting has diverse overlap levels (unlike S_R004S03C01, which was 100% NoOverlap — see the feasibility note below).

## Results

### Overall cpWER

| Strategy | Average cpWER | Note |
|----------|--------------:|------|
| Always-mixed (orcWER) | 1.173 | Baseline |
| Always-separated (cpWER) | 1.591 | Separation tax present |
| **Router v2** | **1.206** | Slightly worse than always-mixed |
| Oracle best | 1.017 | Theoretical ceiling |

Router v2 accuracy (fraction of windows where the router picked the lower-cpWER method): **66/77 = 85.7%**.

### H1a: Router v2 vs Always-Mixed

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ΔcpWER (router_v2 − always_mixed) | +0.0325 |
| Bootstrap 95% CI | [−0.152, +0.186] |
| Verdict | **NOT SUPPORTED** — CI crosses zero; router is marginally worse |

**Why H1a fails:** The router v2 picks "separated" for NoOverlap windows where `mixed_segments_count > 5` (a common case on meeting audio — Whisper produces many short segments). But on AISHELL-4, separated is worse than mixed at NoOverlap (cpWER 1.496 vs 1.293) because the oracle-separated tracks contain long silence regions that trigger Whisper's confident-attractor hallucination (#21). The router's gold-baseline assumption — "separated is better at NoOverlap" — does not transfer to AISHELL-4's oracle-TextGrid separation paradigm.

### H1b: Mixed vs Separated, Stratified by Overlap

| Overlap level | n | Mixed cpWER | Separated cpWER | Δ(sep − mixed) | Mixed better? |
|---------------|--:|------------:|----------------:|---------------:|:-------------:|
| NoOverlap | 41 | 1.293 | 1.496 | +0.203 | ✓ |
| LightOverlap | 24 | 1.056 | 1.691 | +0.635 | ✓ |
| MidOverlap | 11 | 1.000 | 1.720 | +0.720 | ✓ |
| HeavyOverlap | 1 | 1.000 | 1.667 | +0.667 | ✓ |
| **Low-overlap (0–1)** | **65** | **1.205** | **1.568** | **+0.363** | **✓ SUPPORTED** |

**H1b is SUPPORTED** — at low overlap, mixed ASR achieves lower cpWER than separated ASR (Δ = +0.363, mixed is better).

**Key surprise:** Mixed is better than separated at ALL overlap levels, including HeavyOverlap. This contradicts the gold-baseline finding (where separated won at HeavyOverlap: CER 0.109 vs 0.387). The difference is explained by the separation paradigm:

- **Gold benchmark:** separated tracks are high-quality per-speaker audio from the debate recording (minimal silence, clean speech).
- **AISHELL-4 (this study):** separated tracks are oracle-TextGrid-extracted per-speaker segments within 30 s windows, containing significant silence between speech intervals. This silence triggers Whisper's confident-attractor hallucination (#21), inflating cpWER with insertions.

This is a **boundary condition** on the gold-baseline routing thesis: the "separated wins at high overlap" result depends on the separated tracks being clean (minimal silence). When separated tracks contain silence (as in oracle-TextGrid separation or real-separator output with gaps), the separation tax dominates even at high overlap.

## Interpretation

### What transfers from gold to AISHELL-4

1. **The separation tax exists and is large.** Separated ASR is worse than mixed ASR on AISHELL-4 (cpWER 1.591 vs 1.173), confirming the core phenomenon from findings #11/#14/#21.
2. **Mixed ASR is better at low overlap.** H1b replicates the gold-baseline LightOverlap/MidOverlap mixed-better result on real meeting audio.
3. **The confident-attractor fires on separated tracks.** The high cpWER values (>1.0, indicating insertions) on separated tracks are consistent with the confident-attractor hallucination documented in #21. The oracle-TextGrid separation creates silence regions that trigger the same repetition/hallucination pathway.

### What does NOT transfer

1. **"Separated wins at HeavyOverlap" does not transfer.** On the gold benchmark, separated was dramatically better at HeavyOverlap (CER 0.109 vs 0.387). On AISHELL-4, separated is worse even at HeavyOverlap (cpWER 1.667 vs 1.000). The gold result depends on clean separated tracks; oracle-TextGrid separation introduces silence that triggers hallucination.
2. **Router v2's NoOverlap rule does not transfer.** The router picks "separated" for NoOverlap when the mixed transcript is long, but this is the wrong choice on AISHELL-4 because separated is worse at NoOverlap.
3. **The routing boundary location shifts.** On the gold benchmark, the boundary is at overlap_level 3 (HeavyOverlap → separated). On AISHELL-4, there is no overlap level where separated wins — the boundary would need to be "always mixed" under this separation paradigm.

### Why cpWER values are high (>1.0)

Whisper-tiny is a small model (39M parameters) and the AISHELL-4 meeting audio is challenging (real meeting environment with background noise, overlapping speech, conversational Chinese). cpWER > 1.0 means the hypothesis contains more characters than the reference (insertions/hallucinations). This is expected for a tiny model on real meeting audio and does not invalidate the relative comparison between mixed and separated.

## Limitations

1. **Single meeting.** Only M_R003S02C01 was evaluated (1 of 20 test meetings). A second meeting (S_R004S03C01) was scanned but had 0% overlap (turn-taking monologue), making it unsuitable for testing the routing thesis. Generalization across meetings requires evaluating more sessions.
2. **Oracle separation, not real separator.** The "separated" condition uses TextGrid boundaries to extract per-speaker audio (oracle separation). This isolates the ASR-decoder response to silence/artifacts but does not test a real separator (SepFormer, Demucs). Gap M2 (realistic separator) remains open.
3. **Whisper-tiny only.** The frontier findings use Whisper-tiny for control. A stronger model (Whisper-small/base) may reduce the hallucination rate and change the mixed-vs-separated boundary. Gap E1 (cross-model) remains open.
4. **30 s windows.** The window size is fixed at 30 s. Longer windows may change the overlap distribution and the separation tax magnitude.
5. **cpWER on Chinese characters.** MeetEval treats each Chinese character as a "word." This is standard for Chinese cpWER but means the error rates are character-level, not word-level.
6. **No statistical significance for H1b per stratum.** The HeavyOverlap stratum has n=1, so no per-stratum significance test is possible. The low-overlap aggregate (n=65) is the statistically meaningful comparison.

## Comparison to Gold Baseline

| Metric | Gold (5 cases) | AISHELL-4 (77 windows) |
|--------|---------------:|----------------------:|
| Mixed CER/cpWER | 0.248 (avg) | 1.173 |
| Separated CER/cpWER | 0.278 (avg) | 1.591 |
| Router v2 CER/cpWER | 0.120 | 1.206 |
| Oracle best CER/cpWER | 0.087 | 1.017 |
| Separated wins at HeavyOverlap? | ✓ (CER 0.109 vs 0.387) | ✗ (cpWER 1.667 vs 1.000) |
| Mixed wins at LightOverlap? | ✓ (CER 0.211 vs 0.475) | ✓ (cpWER 1.056 vs 1.691) |

The gold CER values are much lower because the gold cases are short, clean debate audio with high-quality separated tracks. The AISHELL-4 cpWER values are high because the meeting audio is challenging and the oracle-TextGrid separation introduces silence.

## Feasibility Note: S_R004S03C01

An initial scan of 8 AISHELL-4 test meetings found that overlap distribution varies dramatically across meetings:

| Meeting | NoOverlap | LightOverlap | MidOverlap | HeavyOverlap | Avg overlap |
|---------|----------:|-------------:|-----------:|-------------:|------------:|
| S_R004S03C01 | 74 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 |
| L_R003S01C02 | 39 | 25 | 11 | 0 | 0.083 |
| **M_R003S02C01** | **40** | **24** | **11** | **1** | **0.092** |
| L_R004S06C01 | 72 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0.002 |

M_R003S02C01 was selected for its diverse overlap distribution. S_R004S03C01 (the meeting pre-staged in the existing scaffold) is a turn-taking monologue with zero overlap, making it unsuitable for testing the routing thesis but useful as a NoOverlap-only baseline.

## Conclusion

This external validation produces a **mixed result** that is more valuable than a simple confirmation:

- **H1b is confirmed** (mixed < separated at low overlap) — the separation tax replicates on real meeting audio.
- **H1a is not confirmed** (router v2 does not beat always-mixed) — the router's NoOverlap rule does not transfer because oracle-TextGrid separation introduces silence that triggers hallucination.
- **The gold-baseline "separated wins at HeavyOverlap" does not transfer** — this is the most important finding for the project's validity: the routing boundary depends on the separation paradigm, not just the overlap ratio.

**Recommendation for the roadmap:** The next step (Gap M2) should test a real separator (SepFormer) to determine whether the "separated wins at high overlap" result survives when the separator produces continuous speech output (without the silence gaps that trigger hallucination). If SepFormer output also triggers the confident-attractor, the routing thesis needs to be revised: the decision is not "separate vs mixed by overlap" but "separate vs mixed by separation quality" (cf. finding #19, the emotion-fidelity meter as a separation-quality gate).
