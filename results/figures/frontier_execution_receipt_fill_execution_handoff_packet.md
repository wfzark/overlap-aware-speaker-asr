# Frontier Execution Receipt Fill Execution Handoff Packet

This generated packet consolidates the fill execution coordination stack into one entrypoint. It remains experimental/frontier coordination only and does not claim benchmark execution.

## Recommended first action

1. Open the runbook card for the current first frontier (`meeteval_compatibility`).
2. Follow the execution receipt bridge checklist before updating the JSON receipt.
3. Fill `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_execution_receipt.json` only after a real frontier run.

No benchmark execution or external audio staging is claimed until receipts are filled.
