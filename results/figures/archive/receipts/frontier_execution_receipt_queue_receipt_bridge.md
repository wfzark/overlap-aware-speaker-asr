# Frontier Execution Receipt Queue Receipt Bridge

This generated bridge connects the receipt queue operator brief to the current execution receipt target. It remains experimental/frontier coordination only and does not claim benchmark execution.

| operator_frontier | prerequisite_artifact | receipt_target | bridge_note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| meeteval_compatibility | results/figures/frontier_execution_receipt_queue_operator_brief.md | results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_execution_receipt.json | Open the receipt queue operator brief first, then write back through results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_execution_receipt.json after the real meeteval_compatibility frontier run. No benchmark execution is claimed by this bridge alone. |
