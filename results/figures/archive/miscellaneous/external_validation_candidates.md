# External Validation Candidates

This generated note lists candidate external sanity-check datasets. It does not claim that any external benchmark has already been run.

| dataset_name | label | source_note | license_note | fit_note | first_preprocessing_step | next_action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AISHELL-4 | external/sanity-check | Official AISHELL-4 release page and paper. | Check the official license terms before local reuse. | Chinese multi-speaker meeting data with realistic overlap and strong domain relevance. | Map a tiny subset into the repository speaker-reference format. | Confirm license and choose a tiny sanity-check slice. |
| AliMeeting | external/sanity-check | Official AliMeeting dataset release and paper. | Check the official license terms before local reuse. | Meeting-style overlap and diarization structure are close to the current ASR framing. | Select one short meeting excerpt and normalize segment timestamps. | Confirm license and choose one compact overlap-heavy excerpt. |
| AMI | external/sanity-check | AMI Meeting Corpus distribution page. | Check the AMI corpus license and redistribution rules before use. | Classic meeting benchmark with overlap and established evaluation conventions. | Extract one short meeting clip and align speaker annotations to repo schema. | Confirm license and compare one clip against current meeting-style exports. |
| LibriCSS | external/sanity-check | LibriCSS release page and benchmark paper. | Check the official license terms before local reuse. | Overlap-heavy conversational speech is useful for a focused external overlap sanity-check. | Map one overlap condition into the repository transcript/reference format. | Confirm license and choose one overlap condition for a narrow sanity-check. |
