## Frontier Status

| frontier_id | status | evidence_path | expected_output | next_step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| speaker_profile | documented_skill | docs/skills/skill_03_speaker_profile_voiceprint.md | speaker profile triage card | Use the triage card to justify a stronger profile method while keeping the signal scoped to risk detection. |
| meeteval_compatibility | documented_skill | docs/skills/skill_04_meeteval_compatibility.md | MeetEval readiness card | Use the readiness card to stage one narrow dry run before claiming any benchmark bridge. |
| llm_critic | documented_skill | docs/skills/skill_05_agentic_llm_critic.md | qualitative critic queue | Use the review queue to decide which critic-style review queue item should be read first. |
| external_validation | documented_skill | docs/ambitious_research_agenda.md | external sanity-check prioritization card | Use the prioritization card to map one tiny sanity-check slice without claiming a completed benchmark. |
| demo_excellence | documented_skill | docs/skills/skill_06_github_demo_excellence.md | demo-facing storyboard or walkthrough | Use the demo walkthrough to shape a short demo walk before any heavier app build. |

## Interpretation

- The repository keeps gold references and synthetic resources separate.
- The core maintenance files are in place for future agents.
- The frontier status table makes breadth-first experimental directions visible before new code lands.
