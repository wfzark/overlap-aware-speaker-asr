# Cascade Profile Playbook

This generated playbook turns the cascade profile recommendations into deployment-facing guidance.

## accuracy_first

- role: `robust_accuracy`
- family_strategy: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`
- gold_strategy: `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic_strategy: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`
- when_to_use: Use when held-out robustness and stronger accuracy-biased recovery matter more than compute simplicity.
- avoid_when: Avoid when you need the cheapest operating mode or a perfectly stable family recommendation across scopes.
- tradeoff_summary: Best accuracy-biased option with lowest shared robustness rank 1, but it shifts from `router_v2_costed` on gold to `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` on held-out synthetic split.

## balanced

- role: `default`
- family_strategy: `router_v2`
- gold_strategy: `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic_strategy: `router_v2_synthetic_costed`
- when_to_use: Use when you want the cleanest default operating point across scopes and a stable router-family recommendation around router_v2.
- avoid_when: Avoid when your main requirement is either the absolute lowest held-out CER or the lowest compute floor.
- tradeoff_summary: Stable family-level default around `router_v2` with consensus 1.0 and lower synthetic cost than accuracy_first.

## cost_first

- role: `budget_floor`
- family_strategy: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
- gold_strategy: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
- synthetic_strategy: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
- when_to_use: Use when compute cost is the primary constraint and you want the most stable cost-first recommendation.
- avoid_when: Avoid when moderate or heavy overlap accuracy matters more than cost floor.
- tradeoff_summary: Cheapest stable profile built around `fixed_mixed_whisper` with synthetic compute cost 0.674, but it carries the weakest CER.
