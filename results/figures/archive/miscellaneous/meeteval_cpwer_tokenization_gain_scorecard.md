# MeetEval cpWER Tokenization Gain Scorecard

This generated scorecard compares raw official cpWER, character-spaced official cpWER, and bridge-lite evidence. It remains experimental/frontier and does not claim full MeetEval benchmark completion.

Summary: `5/5` cases show positive adaptation gain and aligned character-level scores.
