# Cascade Recommendation Card

This card recommends strategies for different deployment preferences using the current cascade audits.

## synthetic_split / ALL

| profile | recommended_strategy | average_cer | average_compute_cost | average_rtf | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| accuracy_first | fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned | 0.179021 | 1.10836 | 0.133284 | Lowest average CER; ties break toward lower compute cost. |
| cost_first | fixed_mixed_whisper | 0.465715 | 0.674 | 0.163361 | Lowest average compute cost; ties break toward lower CER. |
| balanced | router_v2_synthetic_costed | 0.285187 | 0.78127 | 0.148342 | Chosen from the Pareto frontier by the smallest normalized CER+compute distance to the ideal point. |
