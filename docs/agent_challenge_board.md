# Agent Challenge Board

This board is for future agents that want to do more than preserve the baseline.

## Current Frontier Sequence

Use this order when picking a new breadth-first frontier task:

1. MeetEval compatibility
2. External mini validation
3. Speaker profile / voiceprint-assisted risk detection
4. Agentic LLM critic and repair loop
5. Demo and public-facing GitHub excellence

This sequence is coordination guidance only. It does not claim that any frontier item has been completed.

MeetEval compatibility remains the recommended first fill target. Character-spaced official cpWER (`python -m src.meeteval_cpwer_character_level_official_execution --all`) reconciles `5/5` gold cases with bridge-lite. Tokenization gain handoff completion is `queue_complete`; the tokenization gain frontier fill runbook card now records the ready execution card without claiming full benchmark completion.

Speaker profile execution scaffold completion is `queue_complete` for `NoOverlap`; preflight readiness tracks swapped-bias proxy data before any voiceprint execution — still diagnostic-only. The lightweight audio-profile proxy trial reproduces the swapped-bias pattern, but with only a near-tie confidence gap. The new multi-signal diagnostic now makes that boundary explicit: text and audio agree on direction, yet audio remains only `weak_support`, so the next justified move is a narrow embedding baseline rather than any attribution claim.

## Task Template

For each challenge, write:

- difficulty
- expected owner
- expected output
- success criteria
- risk
- why it matters

## Board Rule

If a task does not answer a clear research question, it should stay out of the core pipeline and move into a skill card, a demo note, or future work.
