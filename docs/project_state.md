# Project State

This document is for future Codex / AI coding agents so they can resume work without losing project context.

## Current Project Title

**When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech**

## Teacher Feedback and Direction Shift

- The core technical baseline is complete.
- Future agents are encouraged to explore the frontier, not just maintain the baseline.
- The project direction has therefore shifted from a maintenance-only mindset to a stable baseline + ambitious frontier exploration mindset.
- The stable baseline remains preserved.
- Future agents may explore phase diagrams, compute-aware cascades, voiceprint ideas, LLM critic loops, external mini validation, and demo excellence.

## Current Core Findings

1. Speech separation is useful but not universally beneficial.
2. `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
3. `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
4. Speaker swap is not the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
5. Overlap-only router v1 performs perfectly on gold but fails on synthetic silver validation.
6. Feature-based router v2 improves robustness using repetition and duplicate-removal signals.
7. Risk-aware selector is a deployability and explainability layer, not the best-CER result.
8. Synthetic benchmarks are silver robustness validation, not gold evaluation.
9. LLM/RAG is optional future extension, not the current core quantitative contribution.
10. The compute-aware cascade is an experimental/frontier cost analysis layer; it evaluates route cost after reference-free decisions are fixed and does not use CER as a routing input.

## Experimental Compute-Aware Cascade Findings

Label: `experimental/frontier`

- `router_v2_costed: average_cer 0.120042, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`
- `risk_aware_costed: average_cer 0.134587, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`
- `budget_cascade: average_cer 0.134587, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`

Outputs:

- `results/tables/cascade_performance.csv`
- `results/figures/compute_aware_cascade_summary.md`
- `results/figures/cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Interpretation:

- This is an offline costed analysis of the five gold cases.
- It uses observed runtime fields when available and deterministic proxy costs otherwise.
- CER is reserved for post-decision evaluation only.

Runtime provenance audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_runtime_audit.md`
- Current committed gold cascade outputs use observed runtime for all `5/5` selections in every reported strategy.
- The proxy cost model remains a guardrail for missing-runtime edge cases rather than an active source in the current gold result tables.

Runtime normalization audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_runtime_normalization.md`
- Gold `router_v2_costed`, `risk_aware_costed`, and `budget_cascade` all show `average_rtf 0.080646` when normalized by selected-route processed audio duration.
- This RTF is not a wall-clock latency claim; separated routes divide by two-stream processed duration.

Pareto frontier audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_pareto.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_pareto.md`
- Gold `ALL` frontier strategies are `fixed_mixed_whisper` and `router_v2_costed`.
- `risk_aware_costed` and `budget_cascade` are dominated by `router_v2_costed`; `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` is also dominated once CER and average compute cost are considered jointly.

Recommendation card:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendations.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendations.md`
- Gold `ALL` recommends `router_v2_costed` for both `accuracy_first` and `balanced`, while `fixed_mixed_whisper` remains the `cost_first` option.

Robustness gap audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_robustness_gap.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_robustness_gap.md`
- Best shared cross-dataset stability currently comes from `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` with `cer_gap_vs_gold -0.00266`.
- Among adaptive shared routes, `router_v2` is more stable than `budget_cascade` on the held-out synthetic split `ALL` view.

Recommendation stability audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_stability.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendation_stability.md`
- `cost_first` is fully stable across gold and synthetic `ALL/DEV/TEST`, always selecting `fixed_mixed_whisper`.
- `balanced` and `accuracy_first` each show `consensus_ratio 0.75`, indicating useful but not perfect cross-scope recommendation stability.

Recommendation family stability audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.md`
- After merging `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` into the same family, `balanced` becomes fully stable with `consensus_ratio 1.0`.
- `accuracy_first` remains the only profile with meaningful family-level disagreement across scopes.

Decision matrix:

- `results/tables/cascade_decision_matrix.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_decision_matrix.md`
- `accuracy_first` now surfaces as the most robust accuracy-biased profile because its synthetic `ALL` recommendation aligns with the best shared robustness rank.
- `balanced` is the cleanest default profile because it combines `router_v2` family stability with mid-pack robustness and lower synthetic `ALL` cost than `accuracy_first`.

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_status.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_status.md`
- This generated status board now shows which benchmark phases are still template-only, how many fields remain open, which blocker category each phase falls into, and which next action should happen before execution can move forward.

Benchmark execution summary:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.md`

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.md`
- This generated blocker matrix now consolidates blocker type, queue priority, dependency state, and pending-field scale so the next contributor can judge urgency from one table.

Benchmark runbook card:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.md`
- This generated runbook card now condenses the first benchmark action, the required evidence, and the completion target into one short execution entrypoint.

Benchmark operator brief:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_operator_brief.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_operator_brief.md`
- This generated operator brief now gives the current benchmark operator one plain-language note covering the next step, required evidence, and urgency.

Benchmark evidence receipt:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_evidence_receipt.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_evidence_receipt.md`
- This generated evidence receipt now shows what the current benchmark run must write back, which completion signal closes it, and what follow-up note should remain for the next contributor.

Benchmark handoff packet:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_handoff_packet.md`
- This generated note now provides one benchmark-entry document that points to the readiness, plan, checklist, manifest template, execution-summary, execution-queue, session-ledger, dependency-graph, blocker-matrix, runbook-card, milestone-card, phase-checkpoint-card, completion-dashboard, operator-brief, evidence-receipt, and status-board layers together.

## Synthetic Split Cascade Validation

Label: `synthetic/silver` and `experimental/frontier`

- `router_v2_synthetic_costed: average_cer 0.285187, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.704888`
- `budget_cascade: average_cer 0.367582, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.854921`
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade: average_cer 0.249877, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.945686`

Outputs:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_performance.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_summary.md`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Interpretation:

- This is a held-out silver validation layer on top of the existing synthetic split benchmark.
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade` improves CER over `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, but spends more compute.
- `budget_cascade` is cheaper than always separated, but loses too much CER on the synthetic split benchmark.
- Silver validation remains separate from gold benchmark claims.

Runtime provenance audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.md`
- Current committed synthetic split cascade outputs use observed runtime for all `100/100` `ALL` selections and all `50/50` selections in both `DEV` and `TEST`.
- The proxy cost model remains available for missing-runtime future experiments, but it is not active in the current synthetic split tables.

Runtime normalization audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.md`
- `router_v2_synthetic_costed: average_rtf 0.148342`
- `budget_cascade: average_rtf 0.148228`
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade: average_rtf 0.156245`
- These values are normalized by selected-route processed audio duration, not by a single mixed-stream wall-clock target.

Pareto frontier audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.md`
- Synthetic split `ALL` frontier strategies are `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, and `cleaned_preferred_cascade`.
- `budget_cascade` is dominated by `router_v2_synthetic_costed` on the held-out synthetic split `ALL` scope.

Recommendation card:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.md`
- Synthetic split `ALL` recommends `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` for `accuracy_first`, `fixed_mixed_whisper` for `cost_first`, and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` for `balanced`.

## What Should Happen Next

The next stage is not another maintenance loop. It should focus on:

- final REPORT.md polish
- README polish
- Streamlit demo
- presentation / video script
- contribution / maintenance clarity
- ambitious exploration docs
- experimental frontier work

Frontier harness breadth status:

- `results/figures/project_harness_report.md`
- The harness report now includes a generated `frontier_status` table covering `speaker_profile`, `meeteval_compatibility`, `llm_critic`, `external_validation`, and `demo_excellence` so breadth-first work can be spread across multiple frontiers.

Frontier execution queue:

- `results/figures/frontier_execution_queue.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_execution_queue.json`
- This queue now turns the status table into a coordination layer. It does not claim new experimental evidence; it simply orders which frontier handoff looks most actionable next.
- Current queue head: `meeteval_compatibility`
- Next breadth-first move: use the MeetEval readiness path to stage a narrow dry run before touching the remaining frontier backlog.

Frontier focus card:

- `results/figures/frontier_focus_card.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_focus_card.json`
- This card now turns the queue head into a one-glance starting point. It remains a coordination artifact rather than a new frontier result.

Frontier handoff packet:

- `results/figures/frontier_handoff_packet.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_handoff_packet.json`
- This packet now points that same queue head directly at its next artifact and expected evidence target. It is still a coordination layer only, not a claim that the queued frontier work has already been executed.

Frontier receipt packet:

- `results/figures/frontier_receipt_packet.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_receipt_packet.json`
- This packet now pushes the same coordination layer one step further down to the receipt level. It still does not claim any executed frontier work; it only shows which prerequisite artifact should be opened first and which receipt target should eventually receive the writeback.

Frontier receipt checklist:

- `results/figures/frontier_receipt_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_receipt_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the receipt packet into an ordered writeback path. It stays explicitly coordination-only, keeps the receipt target visible, and helps a future agent complete the frontier closeout sequence in order.

Frontier receipt map:

- `results/figures/frontier_receipt_map.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_receipt_map.json`
- This map now broadens that receipt-aware layer across every current frontier. It still does not claim any executed frontier work; it simply lets the next contributor scan queue order, prerequisite artifacts, and receipt targets for the whole breadth-first set in one place.

Frontier parallel picklist:

- `results/figures/frontier_parallel_picklist.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_parallel_picklist.json`
- This picklist now turns that same breadth-first set into a parallel-friendly pickup view. It still does not claim any executed frontier work; it simply lets the next contributor see which artifact to open and where to write back for each current frontier without changing queue order.

Frontier parallel picklist checklist:

- `results/figures/frontier_parallel_picklist_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_parallel_picklist_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the parallel picklist into an ordered pickup path. It stays explicitly coordination-only, keeps the pickup artifact visible, and helps a future agent follow the parallel-friendly frontier path in order.

Frontier receipt board:

- `results/figures/frontier_receipt_board.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_receipt_board.json`
- This board now condenses the same breadth-first set into a single receipt snapshot. It still does not claim any executed frontier work; it simply keeps queue order, pickup artifact, and receipt target visible together for the next pass.

Frontier receipt board checklist:

- `results/figures/frontier_receipt_board_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_receipt_board_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the receipt board into an ordered snapshot path. It stays explicitly coordination-only, keeps the board snapshot visible, and helps a future agent advance the frontier queue in order.

Frontier coordination matrix:

- `results/figures/frontier_coordination_matrix.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_coordination_matrix.json`
- This matrix now gives the same breadth-first set a denser scan view. It still does not claim any executed frontier work; it simply keeps queue order, entry artifact, pickup artifact, and receipt target visible together for the next pass.

Frontier coordination checklist:

- `results/figures/frontier_coordination_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_coordination_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the coordination matrix into an ordered scan path. It stays explicitly coordination-only, keeps the entry artifact visible, and helps a future agent follow the frontier scan in order.

Frontier writeback index:

- `results/figures/frontier_writeback_index.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_writeback_index.json`
- This index now separates the receipt target from the rest of the scan view. It still does not claim any executed frontier work; it simply keeps queue order, entry artifact, and receipt target visible together for a tighter writeback pass.

Benchmark frontier bridge:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_frontier_bridge.md`
- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_frontier_bridge.csv`
- This bridge now links the benchmark operator brief back to the broader frontier queue so the runtime-foundation work remains visible inside the breadth-first coordination layer.

Benchmark receipt bridge:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_receipt_bridge.md`
- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_receipt_bridge.csv`
- This bridge now links the benchmark handoff packet directly to the benchmark evidence receipt. It still does not claim any executed benchmark run; it simply shows which packet should be opened first and which receipt target should eventually capture the writeback.

Benchmark evidence checklist:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_evidence_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_evidence_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the evidence receipt into an ordered writeback path. It stays explicitly coordination-only, keeps the receipt target visible, and helps a future agent complete the benchmark closeout sequence in order.

MeetEval compatibility bridge:

- `results/figures/meeteval_compatibility_note.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_reference_segments.jsonl`
- `results/tables/meeteval_hypothesis_segments.jsonl`
- This bridge now exports verified gold reference segments and speaker-attributed hypothesis segments in a simple JSONL form so future agents can continue toward MeetEval / cpWER compatibility without overstating the current evaluation scope.

MeetEval readiness bridge:

- `results/figures/meeteval_readiness.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_readiness.csv`
- This bridge now turns the compatibility export into a small handoff card for a narrow dry run. It still does not claim MeetEval execution, and it makes the current limitation visible by recording that cleaned fallback remains common across the exported cases.

MeetEval dry run handoff bridge:

- `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_handoff.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_dry_run_handoff.csv`
- This bridge now turns the readiness state into a single next-step packet. It still does not claim that MeetEval or cpWER has been executed; it only specifies the first recommended slice, the dominant blocker, and the evidence file that a future dry run should leave behind.

MeetEval dry run receipt bridge:

- `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_receipt.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_dry_run_receipt.json`
- This bridge now materializes that expected evidence target as a template-only receipt. It still does not claim any executed dry run; it simply defines what the first narrow diagnostic follow-up should write back once it actually happens.

MeetEval dry run checklist bridge:

- `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_dry_run_checklist.csv`
- This bridge now orders the verified cases into a checklist for the first diagnostic dry run. It still does not claim any MeetEval or cpWER execution; it simply helps the next contributor pick the cleanest exported case first.

Speaker profile similarity bridge:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_risk_summary.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_similarity.csv`
- This bridge now turns `con/pro` snippet transcripts into a lightweight text-profile overlap signal. The current result is useful mainly because it exposes a failure mode: the simple profile signal prefers swapped alignment across the verified gold cases, which argues for caution rather than confidence.

Speaker profile triage bridge:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_triage.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_triage.csv`
- This bridge now turns the per-case table into an aggregate handoff card. It stays explicitly in the risk-signal lane, records that the current gold set is entirely dominated by `swapped_bias`, and points the next contributor toward trying a stronger profile method rather than overstating attribution quality.

Speaker profile method handoff bridge:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_method_handoff.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_method_handoff.csv`
- This bridge now turns that aggregate finding into a single stronger-method packet. It still does not claim voiceprint success; it only records the first method direction, the expected evidence target, and a handoff note that keeps the current signal firmly in the diagnostic lane.

Speaker profile method receipt bridge:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_method_receipt.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_method_receipt.json`
- This bridge now materializes the expected evidence slot for that stronger-method trial as a template-only receipt. It still does not claim any executed profile improvement; it simply defines what the first stronger-method follow-up should write back once it actually happens.

LLM critic qualitative bridge:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_qualitative_note.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_qualitative_summary.csv`
- This bridge now turns structured risk cues into a qualitative critic-style note. It is intentionally labeled `qualitative/demo` and helps explain what might be repaired first without claiming that any transcript has been verified or improved.

LLM critic review queue bridge:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_queue.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_review_queue.csv`
- This bridge now turns the critic note into a lightweight triage order. It stays explicitly qualitative, recommends which case to inspect first, and currently highlights that swapped-profile uncertainty remains widespread across the gold cases.

LLM critic review receipt bridge:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_receipt.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_review_receipt.json`
- This bridge now materializes the expected evidence slot for that first critic-style pass as a template-only receipt. It still does not claim any executed repair; it simply defines what the first qualitative review follow-up should write back once it actually happens.

LLM critic review checklist bridge:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_review_checklist.csv`
- This bridge now turns the review queue into an ordered execution checklist. It stays explicitly `qualitative/demo`, keeps the receipt target visible, and helps a future agent pick the first critic-style pass without implying that any repair has already been verified.

External validation candidate bridge:

- `results/figures/external_validation_candidates.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_candidates.csv`
- This bridge now turns the external-mini-validation frontier into an explicit `external/sanity-check` candidate card. It records source, license, fit, preprocessing, and next-action notes for AISHELL-4, AliMeeting, AMI, and LibriCSS without claiming that any external benchmark has already been executed.

External validation prioritization bridge:

- `results/figures/external_validation_prioritization.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_prioritization.csv`
- This bridge now turns the candidate card into a lightweight execution order. It recommends `AISHELL-4` as the first tiny sanity-check target and records priority tier, readiness note, why-now context, and next action while preserving the `external/sanity-check` label.

External validation slice handoff bridge:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_handoff.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_slice_handoff.csv`
- This bridge now turns that prioritized target into a single first-slice packet. It still does not claim any external execution; it only defines the first slice shape, license gate, mapping artifact, and dry-run goal for the narrowest external follow-up.

External validation slice receipt bridge:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_receipt.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_slice_receipt.json`
- This bridge now materializes the expected evidence slot for that first slice as a template-only receipt. It still does not claim any executed external sanity-check; it simply defines what the first narrow follow-up should write back once it actually happens.

External validation checklist bridge:

- `results/figures/external_validation_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_checklist.csv`
- This bridge now turns the prioritized external candidates into an execution checklist. It still stays in `external/sanity-check` mode and does not claim that any external validation run has been completed.

External validation skill card:

- `docs/skills/skill_07_external_validation.md`
- This repository now has a dedicated skill card for the external mini-validation frontier, so the queue-head task can be picked up directly from the skills index instead of only from the roadmap and project-state layers.

Demo storyboard bridge:

- `results/figures/demo_storyboard.md`
- `results/tables/demo_storyboard_cards.json`
- This bridge now turns the repository into a one-page demo-facing story so a new visitor can understand the problem, pipeline, findings, and frontier directions quickly without opening the full report first.

Demo walkthrough bridge:

- `results/figures/demo_walkthrough.md`
- `results/tables/demo_walkthrough_steps.json`
- This bridge now turns the storyboard into a short ordered talk track. It does not claim new evaluation results; it simply maps problem framing, baseline evidence, routing takeaway, frontier breadth, and next-step framing onto the existing artifact set.

Demo walkthrough receipt bridge:

- `results/figures/demo_walkthrough_receipt.md`
- `results/tables/demo_walkthrough_receipt.json`
- This bridge now materializes the expected evidence slot for that walkthrough as a template-only receipt. It still does not claim any executed demo delivery; it simply defines what the first narrow presentation follow-up should write back once it actually happens.

Demo walkthrough checklist bridge:

- `results/figures/demo_walkthrough_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/demo_walkthrough_checklist.csv`
- This bridge now turns the walkthrough into an ordered presentation checklist. It stays explicitly `qualitative/demo`, keeps the receipt target visible, and helps a future agent follow the short demo script without implying that a live demo has already been completed.

## How to Resume Work

Common commands:

```powershell
python -m src.adaptive_router_v2
python -m src.evaluate_error_types --case all
python -m src.evaluate_speaker_cer --case all
python -m src.evaluate_cpcer_lite --case all
python -m src.risk_aware_selector --case all
python -m src.compute_aware_cascade
python -m src.compute_aware_cascade --dataset synthetic_split
python -m src.router_ablation
python -m src.router_ablation_split
python -m src.project_harness
```

## Notes for Future Agents

- Do not use ground-truth CER or reference transcripts as routing input.
- References and CER are for evaluation only.
- Keep gold and synthetic evaluation clearly separated.
- Prefer adding new outputs over overwriting existing benchmark files.
- If a new stage changes the main conclusion, update README and REPORT together.
