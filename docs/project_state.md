# Project State

This document is for future Codex / AI coding agents so they can resume work without losing project context.

## Current Project Title

**When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech**

## Teacher Feedback and Direction Shift

- The core technical baseline is complete.
- Future agents are encouraged to explore the frontier, not just maintain the baseline.
- The project direction has therefore shifted from a maintenance-only mindset to a stable baseline + ambitious frontier exploration mindset.

## Current Core Findings

1. Speech separation is useful but not universally beneficial.
2. `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
3. `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
4. Speaker swap is not the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
5. Overlap-only router v1 performs perfectly on gold but fails on synthetic silver validation.
6. Feature-based router v2 improves robustness using repetition and duplicate-removal signals.
7. Risk-aware selector is a deployability and explainability layer, not the best-CER result.
8. Synthetic benchmarks are silver robustness validation, not gold evaluation.
9. LLM/RAG is optional future extension, not the current core quantitative contribution.
10. The compute-aware cascade is an experimental/frontier cost analysis layer; it evaluates route cost after reference-free decisions are fixed and does not use CER as a routing input.
11. The separation-hallucination silence cure is recoverable under broadband noise, but not babble. #806 found the energy-based silence trim is exactly inert under noise (fires on 0% of tracks). A reference-free spectral-flatness + noise-floor-relative-energy gate (`src/noise_robust_gate.py`) re-fires under white noise; applied selectively via the existing compression-ratio guard (CR>2.4), it cuts pooled-noisy separated CER 1.15→0.69 (Whisper-tiny, synthetic oracle, gating only ~7% of tracks; catastrophic-tail tracks 5.31→1.05). Boundary: the gate safely abstains under pink (1/f) noise and largely fails under speech-like babble (flatness contrast collapses), so spectral gating is a broadband-noise cure — separating a target from babble residual needs speaker identity, motivating a voiceprint-conditioned gate (bridge to the speaker-profile frontier). On real-separator gold audio the effect is small and only net-positive when guard-gated. `experimental/frontier`; see `results/frontier/noise_robust_gate/FINDINGS.md`.
12. A real speaker embedding cures moderate babble where spectral gating cannot — and is the first ASR-CER win for the speaker-profile frontier. Resemblyzer GE2E (pretrained, weights in the pip wheel → fully offline) separates target-speech from babble-residual at AUC 0.95 (vs flatness 0.56). The speaker-conditioned gate (`src/speaker_conditioned_gate.py`, reference-free: target reference embedding estimated from top-energy windows) cuts babble CER at 10 dB 1.63→0.67 and eliminates the catastrophic tail (0.375→0.000), beating both raw separation and the flatness gate at 5–10 dB. Honest edges: it fails at 0 dB babble (audio too corrupted to recover; mis-crop hurts) and is neutral/harmful on white/pink — so no single gate dominates. The deployable answer is reference-free gate SELECTION (residual flatness → broadband⇒flatness gate, speech-like⇒speaker gate), the project's routing thesis at the gate level. `experimental/frontier`; resemblyzer is an optional frontier dep; see `results/frontier/speaker_conditioned_gate/FINDINGS.md`.
13. The reference-free gate SELECTOR proposed by #12 does not work — and falsifying it produced a stronger result. Tested over 288 conditions (8 pairs × white/pink/babble × 10/5/0 dB × low {0.1,0.3} and high {0.6,0.8} overlap; `src/gate_selector.py`), the selection *signal* is excellent — residual spectral flatness separates the three noise types at pairwise AUC 1.0 (white 0.48–0.54, pink 0.16, babble 0.09) — but the *premise* fails: the arm flatness selects for (the flatness gate) is itself the harmful arm (combined CER 1.445, worst; 3.55 at white 0 dB), so correctly identifying broadband noise routes into harm. H1 is falsified: in both regimes the selector (combined 1.327) loses to **always-speaker (1.235)**, which dominates because the only arm worth switching to is the dominated one. Byproducts: (a) the speaker gate is a BROAD best cure, not the narrow moderate-babble one #12 claimed — best fixed gate pooled at both overlaps, cutting raw-sep 1.344→1.125 at high overlap with tail 0.14→0.09; (b) the flatness gate is harmful applied unconditionally (bounds #11 to its selective CR-guard); (c) the perfect-type-classifier ceiling (1.209) barely beats always-speaker and picks `{white:none, pink:speaker, babble:speaker}` — never the flatness gate — so no reference-free gate selector has a win available. The decision lives at separate-vs-mixed by overlap (mixed best at low overlap 0.932; separation+speaker-gate best at high overlap 1.125), i.e. router_v2's variable, not a gate-selection layer. Actionable: make the speaker gate the default post-separation cure; gate choice is settled. `experimental/frontier`; see `results/frontier/gate_selector/FINDINGS.md`.
14. EMOTION FRONTIER opened — and the separate-or-not decision turns out to be objective-dependent. Operationalizing emotion as gain-invariant acoustic prosody (`src/prosody.py`; arousal-side, no SER model/labels — the clean source's own prosody is the reference, mirroring CER) and modeling imperfect separation as a cross-talk leakage knob `separated_k(α)=track_k+α·track_other`, the "Emotional Separation Tax" study (`src/emotion_separation_tax.py`, 8 pairs × overlap {0,0.1,0.3,0.6,0.9} × α {0,0.15,0.3}) finds: (a) emotion has NO separation tax — separation never hurts prosody recovery (benefit ≥ 0 at all overlaps) and helps more as overlap grows, the OPPOSITE of the ASR tax; gain-invariant so not a loudness effect; the α>0 leaky-separator rows confirm it is not just an oracle artifact. (b) Headline cross-link (Whisper-tiny, same conditions): at low/mid overlap separation HURTS ASR (CER benefit −1.382 at α=0/ov0.1; −1.716 at α=0.15/ov0.3 — the hallucination tax reproduced) but HELPS emotion (+0.09…+0.15); they agree only at high overlap (weak global corr: Pearson 0.08–0.11, Spearman 0.31–0.40, n=40). So ASR-optimal routing (keep low/mid-overlap mixed) forfeits emotional prosody, which separation recovers — a single separate-vs-mixed switch cannot serve both objectives; an emotion-aware system needs objective-aware routing (decode text conservatively, estimate emotion from the separated track) in the identifiable low/mid-overlap disagreement band. `experimental/frontier`; see `docs/emotion_frontier.md` and `results/frontier/emotion_separation_tax/FINDINGS.md`.
15. Emotion is a consequence to preserve, NOT a predictor for routing — the emotion↔ASR relationship is asymmetric. The arousal→ASR-difficulty probe (`src/arousal_asr_probe.py`, 120 tracks) tested whether the reference-free pre-decode arousal index predicts Whisper CER. It does not: Pearson(arousal,CER)=0.002, partial-controlling-overlap=0.002, within-overlap correlations flip sign (+0.20 at ov0 → −0.50 at ov0.9), and arousal is orthogonal to the compression-ratio degeneracy guard (−0.04) despite being a genuinely varying signal (std 0.82). The pre-registered kill criterion is met → arousal adds no independent reference-free ASR-routing signal (the binary hallucination-AUC comparison is underpowered: only 1 CER>1 case in 120, flagged loudly by compression ratio CR=16.3, not by arousal). Combined with #14: separation strongly AFFECTS emotion, but emotion does NOT predict ASR difficulty — so keep the ASR router on overlap/compression-ratio signals and treat per-speaker emotion as a separate output recovered from the separated track. `experimental/frontier`; see `results/frontier/arousal_asr_probe/FINDINGS.md`.
16. Text-side emotion (lexical valence) and a tri-modal separation view — plus an honest underpowering result that motivates the LLM direction. A deterministic offline regex/lexicon valence+arousal reader (`src/lexical_emotion.py`, the "用正则辅助情感分析" ask: negation-flipping within a char window, intensifier scaling, arousal cues) extends emotion to the ASR TEXT. The tri-modal tax (`src/lexical_emotion_tax.py`, 40 conditions at α=0.15) compares the benefit-of-separating across CER, acoustic arousal, and lexical valence: CER shows the tax (−0.36/−1.72 at ov0.1/0.3, +0.23 at ov0.9), acoustic arousal shows none (always ≥0, reconfirming #14), lexical valence is ~flat (−0.004…+0.025); weak pairwise correlation (|Pearson|≤0.11) and frequent sign-disagreement (CER~lexical 0.40, CER~acoustic 0.42) — no single separation decision is optimal across all three. HONEST BOUND: the lexical arm is underpowered here — the seed lexicon fires on only 2/16 casual debate snippets (short conversational fragments rarely carry explicit sentiment words), so the flat lexical signal reflects lexical sparsity, not proven invariance. This directly motivates a generative LLM emotion reader (finding #17, next) that captures implicit/contextual valence a fixed lexicon misses. `experimental/frontier`; see `results/frontier/lexical_emotion_tax/FINDINGS.md`. Frontier reading (2025–26) and code-tape lineage are documented in `docs/emotion_frontier.md`.
17. A local LLM × ASR critic adds cost without winning — the "simple beats fancy" motif (cf. #13), now for LLM-as-judge and GER. Using a real offline LLM (deepseek-r1:7b via ollama; dependency-injected, regex fallback) following the 2025/26 GER + prosody-grounded-SER frontier and code-tape's generation-evaluation separation (separate repair vs judge roles), `src/llm_asr_critic.py` tested two claims on 16 curated separated tracks. C1 (reference-free QE): the LLM judge correlates −0.41 with CER but is DOMINATED by the free Whisper compression-ratio signal (+0.74) — `qe_winner = compression_ratio`. C2 (repair/GER): naive repair net-HARMS (mean CER 0.951→0.983), over-correcting clean text (clean Δ −0.25, e.g. 0.10→0.60) and only net-neutral on hallucination (+0.01); no reference-free gate rescues it (the absolute compression-ratio guard never fires because these separation errors are substitution/deletion, not the repetition type that inflates CR>2.4; judge-gating still applies the unreliable repair). Verdict: keep the cheap compression-ratio QE signal and input-side gating/routing (#11–#13); a local-7B critic is not a deployable cure here, consistent with the 2026 over-correction literature. Honest scope: n=16, fixed prompts, 1-best input, reasoning-model only — a larger/instruct LLM, true N-best, or an edit-distance-bounded acceptance gate are the next steps. `experimental/frontier`; see `results/frontier/llm_asr_critic/FINDINGS.md`.
18. CAPSTONE — objective-aware decoupled routing resolves the #14 divergence into a deployable design. If a system needs both an accurate transcript and per-speaker emotion, a single separate-or-not switch cannot serve both. `src/objective_aware_routing.py` (40 utterances) compares: always-mixed (CER 0.596, emo 0.180), always-sep (1.050, 0.079), coupled one-switch (0.528, 0.139, joint regret 0.046), and DECOUPLED — text from the ASR route, emotion always from the separated track — (0.528, 0.079, joint regret 0.003, ≈ the two-objective oracle 0.000). Decoupling keeps the SAME CER as the single switch but HALVES emotion distortion (≈oracle), cutting joint regret ~14×; the coupling cost (mean 0.060) is concentrated in the low/mid-overlap band #14 identified (+0.119 at ov0.1, +0.096 at ov0.6, 0 at ov0/0.9). Deployable answer to the project's grand question in the multi-objective setting: for text route by the reference-free ASR router; for emotion, always read the separated track. Honest scope: text route is the oracle argmin-CER (isolates the decoupling benefit; a real router raises both CERs equally but cannot change the emotion-axis argument). `experimental/frontier`; see `results/frontier/objective_aware_routing/FINDINGS.md`.

## Experimental Compute-Aware Cascade Findings

Label: `experimental/frontier`

- `router_v2_costed: average_cer 0.120042, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`
- `risk_aware_costed: average_cer 0.134587, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`
- `budget_cascade: average_cer 0.134587, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`

Outputs:

- `results/tables/cascade_performance.csv`
- `results/figures/compute_aware_cascade_summary.md`
- `results/figures/cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Interpretation:

- This is an offline costed analysis of the five gold cases.
- It uses observed runtime fields when available and deterministic proxy costs otherwise.
- CER is reserved for post-decision evaluation only.

Runtime provenance audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_runtime_audit.md`
- Current committed gold cascade outputs use observed runtime for all `5/5` selections in every reported strategy.
- The proxy cost model remains a guardrail for missing-runtime edge cases rather than an active source in the current gold result tables.

Runtime normalization audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_runtime_normalization.md`
- Gold `router_v2_costed`, `risk_aware_costed`, and `budget_cascade` all show `average_rtf 0.080646` when normalized by selected-route processed audio duration.
- This RTF is not a wall-clock latency claim; separated routes divide by two-stream processed duration.

Pareto frontier audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_pareto.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_pareto.md`
- Gold `ALL` frontier strategies are `fixed_mixed_whisper` and `router_v2_costed`.
- `risk_aware_costed` and `budget_cascade` are dominated by `router_v2_costed`; `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` is also dominated once CER and average compute cost are considered jointly.

Recommendation card:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendations.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendations.md`
- Gold `ALL` recommends `router_v2_costed` for both `accuracy_first` and `balanced`, while `fixed_mixed_whisper` remains the `cost_first` option.

Robustness gap audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_robustness_gap.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_robustness_gap.md`
- Best shared cross-dataset stability currently comes from `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` with `cer_gap_vs_gold -0.00266`.
- Among adaptive shared routes, `router_v2` is more stable than `budget_cascade` on the held-out synthetic split `ALL` view.

Recommendation stability audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_stability.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendation_stability.md`
- `cost_first` is fully stable across gold and synthetic `ALL/DEV/TEST`, always selecting `fixed_mixed_whisper`.
- `balanced` and `accuracy_first` each show `consensus_ratio 0.75`, indicating useful but not perfect cross-scope recommendation stability.

Recommendation family stability audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.md`
- After merging `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` into the same family, `balanced` becomes fully stable with `consensus_ratio 1.0`.
- `accuracy_first` remains the only profile with meaningful family-level disagreement across scopes.

Decision matrix:

- `results/tables/cascade_decision_matrix.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_decision_matrix.md`
- `accuracy_first` now surfaces as the most robust accuracy-biased profile because its synthetic `ALL` recommendation aligns with the best shared robustness rank.
- `balanced` is the cleanest default profile because it combines `router_v2` family stability with mid-pack robustness and lower synthetic `ALL` cost than `accuracy_first`.

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_bridge_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_slice_bridge_checklist.csv`
- This checklist turns the first external handoff into a bridge verification path between the slice handoff and the slice receipt. It stays labeled `external/sanity-check` and does not claim any executed external benchmark.

## Synthetic Split Cascade Validation

Label: `synthetic/silver` and `experimental/frontier`

- `router_v2_synthetic_costed: average_cer 0.285187, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.704888`
- `budget_cascade: average_cer 0.367582, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.854921`
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade: average_cer 0.249877, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.945686`

Outputs:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_performance.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_summary.md`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Interpretation:

- This is a held-out silver validation layer on top of the existing synthetic split benchmark.
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade` improves CER over `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, but spends more compute.
- `budget_cascade` is cheaper than always separated, but loses too much CER on the synthetic split benchmark.
- Silver validation remains separate from gold benchmark claims.

Runtime provenance audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.md`
- Current committed synthetic split cascade outputs use observed runtime for all `100/100` `ALL` selections and all `50/50` selections in both `DEV` and `TEST`.
- The proxy cost model remains available for missing-runtime future experiments, but it is not active in the current synthetic split tables.

Runtime normalization audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.md`
- `router_v2_synthetic_costed: average_rtf 0.148342`
- `budget_cascade: average_rtf 0.148228`
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade: average_rtf 0.156245`
- These values are normalized by selected-route processed audio duration, not by a single mixed-stream wall-clock target.

Pareto frontier audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.md`
- Synthetic split `ALL` frontier strategies are `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, and `cleaned_preferred_cascade`.
- `budget_cascade` is dominated by `router_v2_synthetic_costed` on the held-out synthetic split `ALL` scope.

Recommendation card:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.md`
- Synthetic split `ALL` recommends `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` for `accuracy_first`, `fixed_mixed_whisper` for `cost_first`, and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` for `balanced`.

## What Should Happen Next

The next stage is not another maintenance loop. It should focus on:

- final REPORT.md polish
- README polish
- Streamlit demo
- presentation / video script
- contribution / maintenance clarity
- ambitious exploration docs
- experimental frontier work

Frontier harness breadth status:

- `results/figures/project_harness_report.md`
- The harness report now includes a generated `frontier_status` table covering `speaker_profile`, `meeteval_compatibility`, `llm_critic`, `external_validation`, and `demo_excellence` so breadth-first work can be spread across multiple frontiers.

Frontier status checklist:

- This checklist turns the method handoff into an ordered bridge verification path between the handoff and receipt. It stays coordination-only and does not claim that any stronger speaker-profile method has already happened.

Speaker profile embedding scaffold bridge:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_embedding_scaffold.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_embedding_scaffold.json`

- `results/tables/speaker_profile_audio_proxy_summary.csv`
- The first narrow audio-profile proxy trial now exists as a real acoustic-side experiment rather than a text-only scaffold. It still argues for caution, not confidence: all five gold cases remain `swapped_bias`, but the average confidence gap is only `0.000013`, so the lightweight proxy currently looks too weak for attribution claims and is best treated as diagnostic-only frontier evidence.

## Notes for Future Agents

- Do not use ground-truth CER or reference transcripts as routing input.
- References and CER are for evaluation only.
- Keep gold and synthetic evaluation clearly separated.
- Prefer adding new outputs over overwriting existing benchmark files.
- If a new stage changes the main conclusion, update README and REPORT together.
