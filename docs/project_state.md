# Project State

This document is for future Codex / AI coding agents so they can resume work without losing project context.

## Current Project Title

**When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech**

## Teacher Feedback and Direction Shift

- The core technical baseline is complete.
- Future agents are encouraged to explore the frontier, not just maintain the baseline.
- The project direction has therefore shifted from a maintenance-only mindset to a stable baseline + ambitious frontier exploration mindset.
- The stable baseline remains preserved.
- Future agents may explore phase diagrams, compute-aware cascades, voiceprint ideas, LLM critic loops, external mini validation, and demo excellence.

## Current Core Findings

1. Speech separation is useful but not universally beneficial.
2. `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
3. `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
4. Speaker swap is not the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
5. Overlap-only router v1 performs perfectly on gold but fails on synthetic silver validation.
6. Feature-based router v2 improves robustness using repetition and duplicate-removal signals.
7. Risk-aware selector is a deployability and explainability layer, not the best-CER result.
8. Synthetic benchmarks are silver robustness validation, not gold evaluation.
9. LLM/RAG is optional future extension, not the current core quantitative contribution.
10. The compute-aware cascade is an experimental/frontier cost analysis layer; it evaluates route cost after reference-free decisions are fixed and does not use CER as a routing input.

## Experimental Compute-Aware Cascade Findings

Label: `experimental/frontier`

- `router_v2_costed: average_cer 0.120042, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`
- `risk_aware_costed: average_cer 0.134587, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`
- `budget_cascade: average_cer 0.134587, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.929533`

Outputs:

- `results/tables/cascade_performance.csv`
- `results/figures/compute_aware_cascade_summary.md`
- `results/figures/cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Interpretation:

- This is an offline costed analysis of the five gold cases.
- It uses observed runtime fields when available and deterministic proxy costs otherwise.
- CER is reserved for post-decision evaluation only.

Runtime provenance audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_runtime_audit.md`
- Current committed gold cascade outputs use observed runtime for all `5/5` selections in every reported strategy.
- The proxy cost model remains a guardrail for missing-runtime edge cases rather than an active source in the current gold result tables.

Runtime normalization audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_runtime_normalization.md`
- Gold `router_v2_costed`, `risk_aware_costed`, and `budget_cascade` all show `average_rtf 0.080646` when normalized by selected-route processed audio duration.
- This RTF is not a wall-clock latency claim; separated routes divide by two-stream processed duration.

Pareto frontier audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_pareto.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_pareto.md`
- Gold `ALL` frontier strategies are `fixed_mixed_whisper` and `router_v2_costed`.
- `risk_aware_costed` and `budget_cascade` are dominated by `router_v2_costed`; `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` is also dominated once CER and average compute cost are considered jointly.

Recommendation card:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendations.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendations.md`
- Gold `ALL` recommends `router_v2_costed` for both `accuracy_first` and `balanced`, while `fixed_mixed_whisper` remains the `cost_first` option.

Robustness gap audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_robustness_gap.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_robustness_gap.md`
- Best shared cross-dataset stability currently comes from `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` with `cer_gap_vs_gold -0.00266`.
- Among adaptive shared routes, `router_v2` is more stable than `budget_cascade` on the held-out synthetic split `ALL` view.

Recommendation stability audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_stability.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendation_stability.md`
- `cost_first` is fully stable across gold and synthetic `ALL/DEV/TEST`, always selecting `fixed_mixed_whisper`.
- `balanced` and `accuracy_first` each show `consensus_ratio 0.75`, indicating useful but not perfect cross-scope recommendation stability.

Recommendation family stability audit:

- `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.md`
- After merging `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` into the same family, `balanced` becomes fully stable with `consensus_ratio 1.0`.
- `accuracy_first` remains the only profile with meaningful family-level disagreement across scopes.

Decision matrix:

- `results/tables/cascade_decision_matrix.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_decision_matrix.md`
- `accuracy_first` now surfaces as the most robust accuracy-biased profile because its synthetic `ALL` recommendation aligns with the best shared robustness rank.
- `balanced` is the cleanest default profile because it combines `router_v2` family stability with mid-pack robustness and lower synthetic `ALL` cost than `accuracy_first`.

Frontier report:

- `results/figures/cascade_frontier_report.md`
- This generated note now acts as the single-entry summary for the current compute-aware cascade frontier evidence.

Artifact index:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_checklist.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_checklist.md`
- This generated checklist now records the run metadata and acceptance checks required for each controlled benchmark phase.

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_manifest_template.csv`
- This generated fill-in template now turns the checklist metadata requirements into a session log skeleton for real controlled timing runs.

Benchmark status board:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_status.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_status.md`
- This generated status board now shows which benchmark phases are still template-only, how many fields remain open, which blocker category each phase falls into, and which next action should happen before execution can move forward.

Benchmark execution summary:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.md`
- This generated summary now rolls the status board up by phase so the next contributor can see blocker totals, readiness, and the top recommended next action before drilling into individual steps.

Benchmark execution queue:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_execution_queue.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_queue.md`
- This generated queue now converts the status stack into an ordered run list so the next contributor can tell which benchmark step should execute or be reviewed first.

Benchmark session ledger:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_session_ledger.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_session_ledger.md`
- This generated ledger now bridges the queue and manifest layers so the next contributor can see which evidence anchor and completion note each queued step must leave behind.

Benchmark dependency graph:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_dependency_graph.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_dependency_graph.md`
- This generated dependency graph now shows which benchmark step unlocks or blocks the next downstream step in the controlled-benchmark sequence.

Benchmark blocker matrix:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.md`
- This generated blocker matrix now consolidates blocker type, queue priority, dependency state, and pending-field scale so the next contributor can judge urgency from one table.

Benchmark runbook card:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.md`
- This generated runbook card now condenses the first benchmark action, the required evidence, and the completion target into one short execution entrypoint.

Benchmark milestone card:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_milestone_card.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_milestone_card.md`

- This generated phase checkpoint card now shows each phase's current blocker, next action, and completion signal as a compact execution check.

Benchmark completion dashboard:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_completion_dashboard.csv`
- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_completion_dashboard.md`
- This generated completion dashboard now gives one short overview of the current start step, dominant blocker family, and remaining pending phase count.

Benchmark handoff packet:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_handoff_packet.md`
- This generated note now provides one benchmark-entry document that points to the readiness, plan, checklist, manifest template, execution-summary, execution-queue, session-ledger, dependency-graph, blocker-matrix, runbook-card, milestone-card, phase-checkpoint-card, completion-dashboard, and status-board layers together.

## Synthetic Split Cascade Validation

Label: `synthetic/silver` and `experimental/frontier`

- `router_v2_synthetic_costed: average_cer 0.285187, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.704888`
- `budget_cascade: average_cer 0.367582, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.854921`
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade: average_cer 0.249877, relative_cost_vs_fixed_separated 0.945686`

Outputs:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_performance.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_summary.md`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Interpretation:

- This is a held-out silver validation layer on top of the existing synthetic split benchmark.
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade` improves CER over `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, but spends more compute.
- `budget_cascade` is cheaper than always separated, but loses too much CER on the synthetic split benchmark.
- Silver validation remains separate from gold benchmark claims.

Runtime provenance audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.md`
- Current committed synthetic split cascade outputs use observed runtime for all `100/100` `ALL` selections and all `50/50` selections in both `DEV` and `TEST`.
- The proxy cost model remains available for missing-runtime future experiments, but it is not active in the current synthetic split tables.

Runtime normalization audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.md`
- `router_v2_synthetic_costed: average_rtf 0.148342`
- `budget_cascade: average_rtf 0.148228`
- `cleaned_preferred_cascade: average_rtf 0.156245`
- These values are normalized by selected-route processed audio duration, not by a single mixed-stream wall-clock target.

Pareto frontier audit:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.md`
- Synthetic split `ALL` frontier strategies are `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, and `cleaned_preferred_cascade`.
- `budget_cascade` is dominated by `router_v2_synthetic_costed` on the held-out synthetic split `ALL` scope.

Recommendation card:

- `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.csv`
- `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.md`
- Synthetic split `ALL` recommends `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` for `accuracy_first`, `fixed_mixed_whisper` for `cost_first`, and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` for `balanced`.

## What Should Happen Next

The next stage is not another maintenance loop. It should focus on:

- final REPORT.md polish
- README polish
- Streamlit demo
- presentation / video script
- contribution / maintenance clarity
- ambitious exploration docs
- experimental frontier work

Common commands:

```powershell
python -m src.adaptive_router_v2
python -m src.evaluate_error_types --case all
python -m src.evaluate_speaker_cer --case all

## Notes for Future Agents

- Do not use ground-truth CER or reference transcripts as routing input.
- References and CER are for evaluation only.
- Keep gold and synthetic evaluation clearly separated.
- Prefer adding new outputs over overwriting existing benchmark files.
- If a new stage changes the main conclusion, update README and REPORT together.
