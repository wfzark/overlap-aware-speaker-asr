# Results Index

This file is the curated map for result summaries. It separates reviewer-facing
results from generated historical records.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. [Current results summary](../results/figures/curated/current_results_summary.md)
2. [Adaptive routing summary](../results/figures/curated/best_method_by_case.md)
3. [Risk-aware selector summary](../results/figures/curated/risk_aware_selection_summary.md)
4. [Compute-aware cascade summary](../results/figures/curated/compute_aware_cascade_summary.md)
5. [Mode B cascade tiers summary](../results/figures/curated/cascade_tiers_summary.md)
6. Historical records under `results/figures/archive/`, only when traceability is needed

## Frontier Research Notes

| File | Purpose | Treat As |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/frontier/audio-depth-router.md` | AudioDepth router merge strategy and claim boundary | Frontier Branch Only / Exploratory Research; not a final result claim |
| `docs/frontier/agentic_research_entropy.md` | Meta-analysis of substance-vs-ceremony collapse in this workspace (`results/entropy_audit/`) | experimental/frontier (analysis-only); not an ASR result |
| `results/frontier/decoder_cure_noise/FINDINGS.md` | Decoder-domain cures (beam / native halluc-silence) under noise: negative result — the noise-robust cure is NOT in the decoder (`results/frontier/decoder_cure_noise/`) | experimental/frontier; Whisper-tiny + silver refs; not a gold result |

## Frontier Research: AudioDepth

AudioDepth is documented as a frontier exploratory research line in
[AudioDepth Router Exploratory Study](frontier/audio-depth-router.md). Its
controlled and frontier results should be read as exploratory evidence unless
explicitly linked to verified mainline benchmarks. The results index does not
restore raw frontier dumps, archived wave/writeback files, large `.npy` arrays,
or bulk visualization outputs to the primary reading path.

## Historical Archive

The generated wave / receipt / writeback / bridge-checklist archive that
previously lived under `results/figures/archive/` was removed in the ceremony
purge (see `docs/frontier/agentic_research_entropy.md`). It is recoverable from
git history if ever needed, but it carried no research value and is no longer
part of the repository.
