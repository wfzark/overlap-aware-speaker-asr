## Project Title

**Overlap-Aware Speaker-Attributed ASR with RAG-Enhanced LLM Correction**

中文题目：

**面向重叠语音的说话人归属转写与 RAG 增强纠错系统**

---

## 0. Project Background

Current local resource directory:

```text
D:\mlproject\project1_xutong
```

This directory contains the original project resources from XuTong’s work, including:

```text
Project.md
xutong_paper.pdf
语音识别模型/whisper.py
语音识别模型/voxtral.py
重叠/chongdie.py
重叠/chongdie2.py
audio_exemple/
```

Our project should not directly copy XuTong’s system. Instead, we will build a focused research-engineering project based on its limitations.

The selected course topic is **Project Topic 1**:

```text
Speaker Diarization
Multi-speaker overlapping speech / cross-speech
LLM + ASR synergy
Based on xutong_paper.pdf
Find limitations / missing components
Propose new method and test it
RAG can be integrated
```

Our project focuses on the key bottleneck:

```text
How to improve ASR and speaker attribution under overlapping speech,
and whether RAG-enhanced LLM correction can reduce transcription,
terminology, and speaker attribution errors.
```

# 1. First Step: Create GitHub Repository

## 1.1 Repository Name

Create a new GitHub repository:

```text
overlap-aware-speaker-asr
```

Alternative name:

```text
rag-enhanced-multispeaker-asr
```

Recommended final repository name:

```text
overlap-aware-speaker-asr
```

## 1.2 Initial Git Commands

Run these commands from:

```text
D:\mlproject
```

```bash
mkdir overlap-aware-speaker-asr
cd overlap-aware-speaker-asr
git init
```

Create initial files:

```bash
type nul > README.md
type nul > REPORT.md
type nul > requirements.txt
type nul > .gitignore
```

First commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "init project structure"
```

Then create GitHub repo online and connect remote:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG_OR_USERNAME>/overlap-aware-speaker-asr.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

# 3. Resource Migration

Copy resources from:

```text
D:\mlproject\project1_xutong
```

to the new repository.

## 3.1 Copy Mixed Audio

Source:

```text
D:\mlproject\project1_xutong\audio_exemple\ch\chongdie\mixed_test_audio
```

Target:

```text
resources/mixed_audio/
```

Expected files:

```text
NoOverlap.wav
LightOverlap.wav
MidOverlap.wav
HeavyOverlap.wav
OppositeOverlap.wav
```

## 3.2 Copy Separated Audio

Source:

```text
D:\mlproject\project1_xutong\audio_exemple\ch\chongdie\separated_audio
```

Target:

```text
resources/separated_audio/
```

Expected pattern:

```text
NoOverlap_spk1.wav
NoOverlap_spk2.wav
LightOverlap_spk1.wav
LightOverlap_spk2.wav
MidOverlap_spk1.wav
MidOverlap_spk2.wav
HeavyOverlap_spk1.wav
HeavyOverlap_spk2.wav
OppositeOverlap_spk1.wav
OppositeOverlap_spk2.wav
```

If filenames differ, create a mapping in:

```text
configs/config.yaml
```

## 3.3 Copy Snippets

Source:

```text
D:\mlproject\project1_xutong\audio_exemple\ch\chongdie\pianduan
```

Target:

```text
resources/snippets/
```

These files include:

```text
con_001.wav ... con_011.wav
pro_001.wav ... pro_015.wav
```

They can be used later for speaker profile, debate stance profile, or extra synthetic overlap data.

# 4. .gitignore

Write this `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.venv/
venv/
env/
*.egg-info/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# Model cache

huggingface/
torch_cache/

# Runtime outputs
results/transcripts_raw/*
results/transcripts_speaker/*
results/transcripts_corrected/*
results/summaries/*
results/tables/*
results/figures/*

# Keep result folders
!results/transcripts_raw/.gitkeep
!results/transcripts_speaker/.gitkeep
!results/transcripts_corrected/.gitkeep
!results/summaries/.gitkeep
!results/tables/.gitkeep
!results/figures/.gitkeep

# Large temporary files
*.tmp
*.log

# Environment secrets
.env
api_keys.json
```

Add `.gitkeep` files in empty result directories.

Do not commit model weights or API keys.

---

# 5. Project Core Idea

The project must not be a simple meeting transcription app.

The core research question is:

```text
Under different overlap intensities, when is speech separation useful,
when does it hurt, and can speaker-aware LLM correction plus glossary-RAG
improve the final transcript and summary?
```

Main method:

```text
Adaptive Overlap Routing + Speaker-Aware LLM Correction + Glossary-RAG
```

The system should compare five pipelines:

```text
P1: Mixed audio → ASR
P2: Mixed audio → alternative ASR
P3: Separated spk1/spk2 → ASR → speaker-attributed transcript
P4: P3 → speaker-aware LLM correction
P5: P4 → glossary-RAG enhanced correction
```

---

# 6. Experimental Dataset

Use the five existing Chinese overlap audio files as the main benchmark:

```text
NoOverlap.wav
LightOverlap.wav
MidOverlap.wav
HeavyOverlap.wav
OppositeOverlap.wav
```

Treat them as five overlap levels:

```text
NoOverlap        clean baseline
LightOverlap     light interruption
MidOverlap       medium overlap
HeavyOverlap     serious cross-talk
OppositeOverlap  debate-style conflicting overlap
```

These files are the core experiment set.

Do not start with large external datasets.

---

# 7. Manual Reference Transcripts

Before serious evaluation, create:

```text
references/reference_transcripts.json
```

Format:

```json
{
  "NoOverlap": {
    "audio": "NoOverlap.wav",
    "segments": [
      {
        "start": 0.0,
        "end": 3.2,
        "speaker": "SPEAKER_1",
        "text": "人工校对文本"
      }
    ]
  },
  "LightOverlap": {
    "audio": "LightOverlap.wav",
    "segments": []
  }
}
```

For the first MVP, if exact timestamps are difficult, allow simplified format:

```json
{
  "NoOverlap": {
    "speaker_1_text": "...",
    "speaker_2_text": "...",
    "full_text": "..."
  }
}
```

Manual reference transcripts are required for CER and speaker attribution evaluation.

---

Keep FunASR and SepFormer optional.
```

## Risk 2: LLM hallucinates

Solution:

```text
Use strict JSON output.
Use temperature 0.1.
Tell model not to add information.
Keep original and corrected text side by side.
```

## Risk 3: No reference transcript

Solution:

```text
Manually annotate the five short audio files.
This is mandatory for real evaluation.
```

## Risk 4: Speaker timestamps are imperfect

Solution:

```text
First evaluate speaker-level full text.
Only add timestamp-level evaluation later if time allows.
```

## Risk 5: Project becomes too large

Solution:

```text
Do not train models.
Do not modify Whisper architecture.
Do not implement RoPE.
Do not build complex frontend.
Do not benchmark too many ASR models.
```

# 20. What Not To Do

Do not implement these in MVP:

```text
Training ASR model
Training diarization model
Changing Whisper/RoPE architecture
Full XuTong system replication
Age/gender/emotion prediction
Mobile deployment
Large-scale external dataset evaluation
Complex vector database RAG
```

Optional extensions only after MVP:

```text
FunASR comparison
WhisperX forced alignment
pyannote diarization
SepFormer or MossFormer2 automatic separation
cpWER / WDER advanced metrics
```

# 21. First Concrete Tasks for Codex

Start now with these tasks in order:

```text
Task 1:
Create project repository structure.

Task 2:
Write .gitignore, README skeleton, REPORT skeleton.

Task 3:
Create configs/config.yaml.

Task 4:
Copy audio files from D:\mlproject\project1_xutong into resources/.

Task 5:
Implement src/config.py.

Task 6:
Implement src/audio_manifest.py.

Task 7:
Run audio manifest generation and save results/tables/audio_manifest.csv.

Task 8:
Commit changes with message:
"create project skeleton and audio manifest"
```

After Task 8, stop and report:

```text
1. Files created
2. Files copied
3. Audio manifest summary
4. Any missing paths or filename mismatches
5. Next recommended step
```

---

# 22. Initial Commit Plan

Use meaningful commits:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "create project skeleton"
git add resources configs src
git commit -m "add audio resources and config mapping"
git add src/audio_manifest.py results/tables/audio_manifest.csv
git commit -m "implement audio manifest generation"
```

Each team member should later work on a separate branch:

```text
feature/asr-baseline
feature/speaker-merge
feature/rag-correction
feature/evaluation
feature/demo
feature/report
```

---

# 23. Final Success Criteria

The project is successful if it can show:

```text
1. ASR performance changes as overlap intensity increases.
2. Separated speaker-track transcription improves heavy overlap cases.
3. Separation may not be necessary for clean/no-overlap cases.
4. Speaker-aware LLM correction improves readability and attribution.
5. Glossary-RAG reduces terminology and role-label errors.
6. The system produces structured speaker-attributed summaries.
7. Experiments are reproducible from GitHub.
```

Final deliverables:

```text
GitHub repository
README.md
REPORT.md
Source code
Experiment tables
Figures
Streamlit demo
English presentation video
Contribution document
```
