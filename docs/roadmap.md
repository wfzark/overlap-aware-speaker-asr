Status: an initial `experimental/frontier` offline cascade analysis now exists.

- Script: `python -m src.compute_aware_cascade`
- Table: `results/tables/cascade_performance.csv`
- Summary: `results/figures/compute_aware_cascade_summary.md`
- Figure: `results/figures/cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Update: synthetic split cascade validation now exists as `synthetic/silver` frontier evidence.

- Script: `python -m src.compute_aware_cascade --dataset synthetic_split`
- Table: `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_performance.csv`
- Summary: `results/figures/synthetic_split_cascade_summary.md`
- Figure: `results/figures/synthetic_split_cer_runtime_tradeoff.png`

Update: runtime provenance audit now makes the cost source explicit.

- Gold audit: `results/tables/cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- Synthetic split audit: `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_audit.csv`
- Current committed cascade outputs are fully backed by observed runtime fields; proxy cost remains a fallback for future incomplete-runtime experiments.

Update: runtime normalization audit now makes route-specific RTF explicit.

- Gold normalization: `results/tables/cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- Synthetic split normalization: `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_runtime_normalization.csv`
- The current audit uses selected-route processed audio duration, which is a stronger compute-normalized signal than raw runtime alone but still not a hardware-controlled benchmark.

Update: Pareto frontier audit now makes dominated strategies explicit.

- Gold Pareto audit: `results/tables/cascade_pareto.csv`
- Synthetic split Pareto audit: `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_pareto.csv`
- Current evidence suggests `router_v2_costed` dominates the other adaptive gold cascades, while synthetic split still leaves multiple meaningful frontier options.

Update: recommendation cards now turn the audits into deployment-facing choices.

- Gold recommendation card: `results/tables/cascade_recommendations.csv`
- Synthetic split recommendation card: `results/tables/synthetic_split_cascade_recommendations.csv`
- Current evidence recommends `router_v2_costed` as the gold balanced choice and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` as the synthetic split balanced choice.

Update: robustness gap audit now compares gold and held-out synthetic split directly.

- Cross-dataset gap audit: `results/tables/cascade_robustness_gap.csv`
- Current evidence suggests `router_v2` is the strongest shared adaptive route, while `budget_cascade` is less robust on held-out synthetic split.

Update: recommendation stability audit now checks whether deployment guidance is consistent across scopes.

- Stability audit: `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_stability.csv`
- Current evidence shows `cost_first` is the most stable profile, while `balanced` and `accuracy_first` vary between gold and synthetic settings.

Update: family-level stability audit separates naming drift from true recommendation drift.

- Family stability audit: `results/tables/cascade_recommendation_family_stability.csv`
- Current evidence shows `balanced` is actually stable at the strategy-family level; the remaining cross-scope disagreement is concentrated in `accuracy_first`.

Update: decision matrix now consolidates the cascade recommendation evidence into one deployment-facing table.

- Decision matrix: `results/tables/cascade_decision_matrix.csv`
- Current evidence suggests `balanced` is the cleanest default operating point, while `accuracy_first` is the strongest robustness-first alternative.

Update: a generated frontier report now consolidates the full cascade audit stack.

- Frontier report: `results/figures/cascade_frontier_report.md`
- This gives future contributors one entrypoint before diving into the more granular audit tables.

Update: a generated artifact index now turns the cascade outputs into an explicit registry.

- Artifact index: `results/tables/cascade_artifact_index.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_artifact_index.md`
- This gives future contributors a label-aware lookup table for which cascade artifact is gold-facing, synthetic-facing, or cross-dataset decision support.

Update: a generated benchmark-readiness scaffold now turns the hardware benchmark next step into a concrete handoff.

- Benchmark readiness: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_readiness.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_readiness.md`
- This prioritizes the runtime-facing artifacts that should be refreshed first once controlled same-hardware timing evidence is available.

Update: a generated benchmark plan now turns the readiness scaffold into an execution order.

- Benchmark plan: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_plan.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_plan.md`
- This sequences the controlled benchmark work into gold foundation, synthetic foundation, surface refresh, and cross-dataset refresh phases.

Update: a generated profile playbook now turns the recommendation tables into plain-language deployment guidance.

- Profile playbook: `results/tables/cascade_profile_playbook.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_profile_playbook.md`
- This explains when `balanced`, `accuracy_first`, and `cost_first` should be the default, the robustness-biased alternative, or the compute floor.

Update: a generated benchmark checklist now turns the plan into a per-run execution record.

- Benchmark checklist: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_checklist.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_checklist.md`
- This captures which metadata should be logged and what acceptance signal each benchmark phase must satisfy.

Update: a generated benchmark manifest template now turns the checklist into a fill-in session log.

- Manifest template: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_manifest_template.csv`
- This gives future contributors a concrete table to fill while running controlled timing sweeps instead of collecting benchmark metadata ad hoc.

Update: a generated benchmark status board now turns the manifest template into an execution-progress tracker.

- Benchmark status: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_status.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_status.md`
- This shows which benchmark phases are still template-only, how many metadata fields remain open, which blocker category each phase belongs to, and which stages can move from planning into controlled execution next.

Update: a generated benchmark execution summary now turns the status board into a phase-level triage rollup.

- Benchmark execution summary: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.md`
- This shows blocker totals, readiness by phase, and the top next action before contributors dive into the lower-level status board.

Update: a generated benchmark execution queue now turns the rollup into an ordered next-run list.

- Benchmark execution queue: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_execution_queue.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_queue.md`
- This shows which benchmark step should execute or be reviewed first once contributors move from planning into action.

Update: a generated benchmark session ledger now turns the queue into an evidence-tracking bridge.

- Benchmark session ledger: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_session_ledger.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_session_ledger.md`
- This shows which evidence anchor and completion note each queued benchmark step must satisfy once the run actually happens.

Update: a generated benchmark dependency graph now turns the run list into an unlock chain.

- Benchmark dependency graph: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_dependency_graph.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_dependency_graph.md`
- This shows which benchmark step unlocks the next downstream refresh and which pending steps are still blocked by earlier benchmark work.

Update: a generated benchmark blocker matrix now turns the unlock chain into a triage panel.

- Benchmark blocker matrix: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.md`
- This shows blocker type, queue priority, dependency state, and pending-field scale in one place for faster execution triage.

Update: a generated external validation candidate card now turns the external mini-validation frontier into a concrete dataset triage step.

- External validation candidates: `results/tables/external_validation_candidates.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/external_validation_candidates.md`
- This records source, license, fit, first preprocessing step, and next action for AISHELL-4, AliMeeting, AMI, and LibriCSS, while staying explicitly scoped to `external/sanity-check` planning rather than claiming a completed benchmark.

Update: a generated external validation prioritization card now turns that triage step into a first-action recommendation.

- External validation prioritization: `results/tables/external_validation_prioritization.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/external_validation_prioritization.md`
- This recommends `AISHELL-4` as the first tiny sanity-check target and records priority tier, recommended order, readiness note, and why-now context without claiming a completed external evaluation.

Update: a generated demo walkthrough now turns the storyboard into a short presentation sequence.

- Demo walkthrough: `results/tables/demo_walkthrough_steps.json`
- Summary view: `results/figures/demo_walkthrough.md`
- This keeps the `demo_excellence` frontier lightweight while making live demo or recording flow more explicit: each step points to an existing artifact rather than claiming new model evidence.

Update: a generated llm critic review queue now turns the qualitative note into a first-pass triage order.

- LLM critic review queue: `results/tables/llm_critic_review_queue.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/llm_critic_review_queue.md`
- This remains a `qualitative/demo` artifact. It does not claim repaired transcripts; it simply orders which case should receive the next critic-style review pass and exposes that swapped-profile uncertainty is still common.

Update: a generated benchmark runbook card now turns the triage panel into a one-page execution brief.

- Benchmark runbook card: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.md`
- This shows the first benchmark action, the required evidence payload, and the completion target without needing to open the wider handoff stack.

Update: a generated benchmark milestone card now turns the execution brief into a progress boundary.

- Benchmark milestone card: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_milestone_card.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_milestone_card.md`
- This shows the next milestone, what the current first step unlocks, and how many benchmark phases remain before the controlled stack is fully refreshed.

Update: a generated benchmark phase checkpoint card now turns the progress boundary into a per-phase execution check.

- Benchmark phase checkpoint card: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_phase_checkpoint_card.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_phase_checkpoint_card.md`
- This shows each phase's blocker, next action, and completion signal without reopening the larger packet.

Update: a generated benchmark completion dashboard now turns the phase checks into a top-level pending-state overview.

- Benchmark completion dashboard: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_completion_dashboard.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_completion_dashboard.md`
- This shows the current start step, dominant blocker family, and pending phase count in one place for quick progress scanning.

Update: a generated benchmark operator brief now turns the pending-state overview into a plain-language operator note.

- Benchmark operator brief: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_operator_brief.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_operator_brief.md`
- This shows the single benchmark step to run now, the evidence to collect, and the urgency note without opening the wider stack first.

Update: a generated benchmark frontier bridge now connects that operator note back to the breadth-first frontier queue.

- Benchmark frontier bridge: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_frontier_bridge.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_frontier_bridge.md`
- This stays strictly at the coordination layer: it explains why the benchmark runtime foundation still belongs at the front of the broader work stream without claiming any new timing evidence.

Update: a generated benchmark evidence receipt now turns the operator note into a writeback closeout card.

- Benchmark evidence receipt: `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_evidence_receipt.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_evidence_receipt.md`
- This shows what the current benchmark run must write back, which completion signal closes it, and what follow-up note should remain after the run.

Update: a generated benchmark handoff packet now turns the execution stack into a single benchmark entrypoint.

- Handoff packet: `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_handoff_packet.md`
- This lets future contributors start from one note before diving into readiness, plan, checklist, manifest, execution-summary, execution-queue, session-ledger, dependency-graph, blocker-matrix, runbook-card, milestone-card, phase-checkpoint-card, completion-dashboard, operator-brief, evidence-receipt, and status details.

- Streamlit demo
- presentation / video polish
- architecture diagrams
- onboarding clarity

Update: the project harness now includes a breadth-first frontier status view.

- Harness report: `results/figures/project_harness_report.md`
- This table makes the current status, evidence path, expected output, and next step visible for `speaker_profile`, `meeteval_compatibility`, `llm_critic`, `external_validation`, and `demo_excellence`.

Update: the project harness now also includes a frontier execution queue.

- Frontier queue: `results/tables/frontier_execution_queue.json`
- Summary view: `results/figures/frontier_execution_queue.md`
- This keeps the breadth-first layer actionable without overstating completion: it simply orders the next frontier handoffs that already exist in the repository.

Update: the project harness now also includes a frontier focus card.

- Frontier focus card: `results/tables/frontier_focus_card.json`
- Summary view: `results/figures/frontier_focus_card.md`
- This is the shortest coordination layer in the stack: it shows the current queue head without adding any new experimental claim.

Update: the project harness now also includes a frontier handoff packet.

- Frontier handoff packet: `results/tables/frontier_handoff_packet.json`
- Summary view: `results/figures/frontier_handoff_packet.md`
- This keeps the breadth-first layer moving with less ambiguity: it points the current queue head directly at the next artifact and expected evidence target while remaining coordination-only.

Update: `meeteval_compatibility` now has a first concrete bridge artifact.

- Compatibility note: `results/figures/meeteval_compatibility_note.md`
- Segment exports: `results/tables/meeteval_reference_segments.jsonl`, `results/tables/meeteval_hypothesis_segments.jsonl`
- This is a compatibility bridge only: it exports segment-level reference and hypothesis candidates for future MeetEval / cpWER work without claiming that standard meeting metrics have already been run.

Update: `meeteval_compatibility` now also has a readiness handoff card.

- Readiness card: `results/tables/meeteval_readiness.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/meeteval_readiness.md`
- This keeps the scope narrow: it says the export is ready for a diagnostic dry run, while also recording that cleaned fallback remains common and therefore the bridge is not yet a clean raw-transcript benchmark story.

Update: `meeteval_compatibility` now also has a dry-run handoff packet.

- Handoff table: `results/tables/meeteval_dry_run_handoff.csv`
- Handoff view: `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_handoff.md`
- This is still a coordination artifact rather than an evaluation result: it translates readiness into a single recommended first slice, blocker, and evidence target so the next contributor can run one narrow diagnostic step without overstating progress.

Update: `speaker_profile` now has a first lightweight risk-signal artifact.

- Profile summary: `results/figures/speaker_profile_risk_summary.md`
- Table: `results/tables/speaker_profile_similarity.csv`
- This remains a narrow text-profile bridge rather than a voiceprint result, and its current value is diagnostic: the simple profile signal prefers swapped alignment across the verified gold cases, so it is useful as a warning sign rather than a deployment-ready attribution tool.

Update: `speaker_profile` now also has a triage handoff card.

- Triage card: `results/tables/speaker_profile_triage.csv`
- Summary view: `results/figures/speaker_profile_triage.md`
- This keeps the scope deliberately modest: it aggregates the current failure pattern, records that the gold cases currently collapse into `swapped_bias`, and uses that evidence to justify a stronger next profile method rather than any speaker-ID claim.

Update: `llm_critic` now has a first qualitative artifact.

- Critic note: `results/figures/llm_critic_qualitative_note.md`
- Table: `results/tables/llm_critic_qualitative_summary.csv`
- This is intentionally a qualitative/demo bridge only: it converts structured risk cues into critic-style explanations, candidate repairs, and uncertainty notes without claiming that an actual LLM has verified or fixed the transcript.

Update: `demo_excellence` now has a first lightweight onboarding artifact.

- Demo storyboard: `results/figures/demo_storyboard.md`
- Story cards: `results/tables/demo_storyboard_cards.json`
- This is a simple demo-facing bridge rather than a full app: it gives a new visitor a one-page explanation of the problem, pipeline, findings, and frontier directions before heavier UI work exists.

## Healthy Project Principles

- New experiments should be isolated.
- Stable results should not be overwritten.
- Gold / silver / experimental / demo labels must be clear.
- Every ambitious module needs an owner and output path.
