### Research Thread 1: The Separation Tax — from Mechanism to Model-Scale Dissolution

**Grand RQ:** _Is the "separation tax" — speech separation hurting Whisper ASR at low/mid overlap — a fundamental limitation of overlap-aware ASR, or an artifact of using the weakest model?_

This thread spans 20+ PRs across three phases and constitutes the project's deepest investigation.

#### Phase 1: Oracle-separation phase study + reference-free cure (Issue #795, PR #796)

**Literature gap.** Sato et al. (Interspeech 2021, "Should We Always Separate?") established that separators inject artifacts hurting ASR below an SIR/SNR crossover, proposing a gated router. However, their analysis used a single-sample-per-ratio scatter and did not characterize the _mechanism_ of failure — whether separation uniformly degrades ASR or creates a heavy-tailed hallucination phenomenon.

**Design choices and justification:**

- **Why Whisper-tiny?** We chose the smallest Whisper model (39M parameters) as the primary experimental vehicle because: (a) it is the most resource-constrained realistic deployment target, making separation-overhead most consequential; (b) its small capacity makes separation-induced failures most visible, providing an upper bound on the tax; (c) all prior project baselines used tiny, enabling direct comparison. Faster-Whisper and WhisperX offer speed optimizations but use the same underlying model architecture — they would exhibit the same separation tax. The model-size question is explicitly addressed in Phase 3.
- **Why oracle separation?** We used oracle (ground-truth) separation rather than a real separator (SepFormer, Conv-TasNet) to isolate the effect of separation _itself_ from separator quality. This follows the standard methodology in speech separation evaluation (e.g., Kolbaek et al., 2017) where oracle bounds are studied before realistic separators.

**Pre-registered hypotheses:**

- H1: A continuous separation-gain crossover exists at some overlap ratio r* (confirmed: r* ≈ 0.17).
- H2: The low-overlap penalty is a heavy hallucination tail, not uniform degradation (confirmed: at r=0.10, mean ΔCER = −0.94 but median = 0.00; 6/600 tracks blow up to CER up to 24×).
- H3: A reference-free compression-ratio guard can detect catastrophic hallucination (confirmed: AUC ≈ 1.0 for CER > 1.0).

**Key finding:** The separation tax is a _heavy-tailed hallucination phenomenon_ concentrated in near-silent separated tracks, not a uniform degradation. A guard-gated trim/fallback router closes ~76% of the oracle gap. Detailed results in `results/frontier/separation_tax/FINDINGS.md`.

#### Phase 2: Hallucination mechanism and cure chain (Issues #797–#813, PRs #798–#813)

This phase followed a systematic **cure-search arc** — each negative result narrowing the solution space:

| **Hallucination router** (#797)      | Route by hallucination vs overlap on held-out split?                                 | ❌ **Falsified**: degeneracy router (+0.083 regret) loses to trivial always-trim (+0.041). But the trim recipe generalizes — once you silence-trim, knowing overlap barely matters.             | `results/frontier/hallucination_router/FINDINGS.md`                |
| **Reference-free QE** (#799)         | Do decoder signals predict graded CER?                                               | ◐ Signals are catastrophe _gates_ (AUC 1.0 for CER>1.0) but at chance for moderate CER (AUC ~0.48).

| **Speaker similarity** (#801)        | Does acoustic speaker distance predict separation benefit?                           | ❌ **Negative**: apparent Pearson +0.49 collapses to +0.08 under tail-robust median. Methodological caution: use robust stats.                                                                  | `results/frontier/speaker_similarity_probe/FINDINGS.md`            |
| **Hallucination cure** (#803)        | Can Whisper's native `hallucination_silence_threshold` or beam search cure the tail? | ✅ The catastrophe is a greedy-decoding artifact. All of {silence-trim, native threshold, beam} eliminate the tail (19.84 → ~0.54). Best deployable: silence-trim (−39% mean CER).              | `results/frontier/hallucination_cure/cure_curve.csv`               |
| **Noise robustness** (#805)          | Does the silence-trim cure survive noise?                                            | ❌ **Critical negative**: noise defeats the cure. Trim benefit collapses from +0.239 (clean) to +0.000 at every SNR ≥ 0 dB. Energy-trim needs _actual silence_ — noise fills the gap.           | `results/frontier/noise_robustness/noise_curve.csv`                |
| **Spectral + speaker gates** (#807)  | Can spectral-flatness or speaker embeddings cure hallucination under noise?          | ✅ Spectral gate works for broadband noise; speaker-conditioned gate (Resemblyzer GE2E, AUC 0.95) cures babble (CER 1.63→0.67). No single gate dominates all noise types.                       | `results/frontier/speaker_conditioned_gate/speaker_gate_curve.csv` |
| **Decoder cures under noise** (#809) | Is the noise-robust cure in the decoder, not the audio?                              | ❌ **Negative**: beam search raises mean CER under every noise type (pooled 1.947 vs greedy 1.676). Native silence-threshold fires only 4–33% under noise. The cure must act on the audio.      | `results/frontier/decoder_cure_noise/cure_noise_curve.csv`         |
| **Gate selector** (#811)             | Can a reference-free selector choose between gates by residual character?            | ❌ **Falsified** with a stronger byproduct: the speaker gate dominates on _both_ axes (CER + emotion), so there is nothing to select. The real decision is separate-vs-mixed, not gate-vs-gate. | `results/frontier/gate_selector/FINDINGS.md`                       |
| **Noise-robust router** (#814)       | Can a reference-free router beat fixed strategies under noise?                       | ✅✅ **Strong positive**: router 0.778 vs always-mixed 1.214 / always-gated 1.531. Recovers ~92% of oracle gap. Pearson(CR, separation-tax) = 0.82.                                             | `results/frontier/noise_robust_router/router_curve.csv`            |

**Engineering trade-off: Why Resemblyzer for speaker embedding?** We chose Resemblyzer (GE2E encoder) over alternatives (pyannote.audio, SpeechBrain, wav2vec2-based) because: (a) it is fully offline and lightweight (~45MB), matching our local-first constraint; (b) it produces a single 256-dim embedding per track, enabling fast cosine-distance computation across 600+ conditions; (c) its AUC 0.95 on babble detection was sufficient — a more complex model would add latency without changing the gate-vs-no-gate decision boundary. The honest limitation is that it fails at 0 dB SNR (AUC 0.52 ≈ chance).

**Literature grounding:** The hallucination cure chain connects to Koenecke et al. (ACM FAccT 2024, "Careless Whisper") — Whisper hallucinations concentrate in long silent regions as phrase repetition — and Baranski et al. (ICASSP 2025) — a recurring finite "bag of hallucinations" covers most cases. Our contribution is mapping these findings into the _separation-induced_ regime with noise as an additional axis.

#### Phase 3: Model scale analysis — the separation tax is a tiny-model artifact (Issues #857–#871, PRs #858–#872)

**Critical validity question.** All 29+ frontier studies used Whisper-tiny exclusively. If the separation tax, hallucination thresholds, and routing signals do not generalize to larger models, the practical value collapses.

**Design choices and justification:**

- **Why test tiny/base/small specifically?** These span a 10× parameter range (39M/74M/244M) at 1×/1.93×/6× compute cost, covering the realistic deployment spectrum for edge/real-time ASR. We did not test medium/large because: (a) they require >1GB VRAM, exceeding typical edge constraints; (b) the base result already dissolved the tax, making further scaling less informative.
- **Why not Faster-Whisper or WhisperX?** Faster-Whisper uses CTranslate2 quantization for speed but produces identical logits to vanilla Whisper at the same model size. WhisperX adds forced alignment and VAD preprocessing — useful for production but irrelevant to our controlled overlap×separation experiment. The model _capacity_ (parameter count) is what matters, not the inference engine.

**Pre-registered hypotheses (PR #859):**

- H1: Larger models hallucinate less — the catastrophic tail rate decreases monotonically tiny → base → small. **Confirmed.**
- H2: The separation-tax phase boundary shifts leftward — separation helps at lower overlap for larger models. **Confirmed** (base: separation tax disappears entirely).
- H3: Compression-ratio becomes less discriminative for larger models (signal paradox). **Confirmed** — base's CR is ~1.0 on all inputs, making it useless as a routing signal.

**Headline result:** Whisper-base (74M, 1.93× compute) produces CER = 0.200 _constant across all overlap ratios_ — the separation tax completely vanishes. Zero hallucinations. All 29 routing/gating studies were compensating for tiny-specific weakness.

| **Runtime cascade** (#863)             | Can tiny→base escalation achieve near-base CER at near-tiny compute?   | ❌ CR signal has a binary cliff, not a smooth Pareto.

| **Error profile decomposition** (#865) | Do tiny and base make different _kinds_ of errors?                     | ◐ Both ~70% substitution-dominated.

**Unified conclusion:** "Overlap-aware speaker ASR" as a routing problem is a tiny-model artifact. Whisper-base eliminates the separation tax at 1.93× compute. The remaining 0.200 CER is a hard floor of acoustic ambiguity — not fixable by pattern matching, T/S normalization, or LLM rescoring. Future work should focus on base+ model capabilities and external benchmark validation.

### Research Thread 2: Causal & Internal-State Hallucination Probe (Issue #855, PR #856)

**RQ:** _Can we detect separation-induced hallucination from inside Whisper during decoding, earlier than the output compression-ratio signal?_

**Motivation.** The `separation_tax` phase (Thread 1) closed the _acoustic_ loop — a reference-free compression-ratio guard detects catastrophes at AUC ≈ 1.0. But CR is an **output** signal computed over the _full_ decoded segment; by the time it inflates past 2.4, Whisper has _already emitted_ the repetition loop to the user. A streaming system has already shown garbage. This probe asks whether Whisper's _internal state_ during decoding provides an earlier warning.

**Why look inside Whisper?** Alternative approaches — better output metrics, multi-decode agreement, contrastive decoding — all failed in Phase 2 (Thread 1). The insight from a 3-second smoke test was revelatory: feeding Whisper-tiny a tone surrounded by silence reproduces the loop (token 7322 × 224) with `compression_ratio=37.2`, `no_speech_prob=0.82` (encoder: "no speech"), yet `avg_logprob=-0.065` (decoder: _highly confident_). The loop is a **confident attractor under an input the encoder flags as silent** — an encoder/decoder _decoupling_, not a confidence collapse. This motivated looking at token-level decoder state.

**Literature grounding (6-agent deep-research sweep, `docs/frontier/causal_hallucination_probe_litreview.md`):**

- Aparin et al. (2026, arXiv:2606.07473): Whisper's built-in filter fails because hallucinations carry _elevated_ `avg_logprob`; encoder/SAE latents are linearly separable pre-loop. Steering cuts hallucination 86.9%→27.3%.
- Waldendorf et al. (ACL 2026 Findings, arXiv:2604.19565): Uncertainty metrics fail exactly in the clean/confident regime; attention-collapse-to-early-frames signature; detectors are task/model-specific.
- Wang et al., Calm-Whisper (Interspeech 2025, arXiv:2505.12969): 3/20 decoder self-attention heads cause >75% of non-speech hallucinations; head-mask fine-tune cuts it >80% at <0.1% WER.
- Viakhirev et al. (2026, arXiv:2604.08591): Compression-Seeking Attractor with self-attention rank collapse decoupling decoder from acoustics.
- Corpataux et al. (OpenReview 2026): Per-token Local Confidence Drop detects confident hallucinations as local discontinuities — direct prior art for trajectory detection.
- Sato et al. (Interspeech 2021, arXiv:2106.00949): Separation-hurts-below-a-crossover — established bedrock, not our discovery.

**Honest novelty assessment:** The confident-loop mechanism is now well-established (Aparin, Waldendorf, Calm-Whisper, Viakhirev). We _extend_ it to the separation-tax regime; we do not discover it. The genuinely new contributions are: (1) **token-id repetition lock-in as a causal trip-wire** — no located prior work uses token-id repetition at this granularity as an early detector; (2) **quantifying the offline CR router's gain decay under causal prefix forcing** — an untouched deployment-analysis niche.

**Pre-registered hypotheses and outcomes:**

- **H-M (mechanism):** Catastrophic tracks show higher `avg_logprob` + lower token-id entropy vs clean tracks — confident loop, not confidence collapse. **SUPPORTED (refined).** avg_logprob −0.335 vs −0.739; entropy 1.49 vs 2.33. Honest refinement: `no_speech_prob` is anti-correlated (AUC 0.33), not the signal — the smoke-test "encoder says silent" was near-pure-silence-specific.
- **H-D (latency):** A token-repetition lock-in detector fires earlier than compression-ratio. **SUPPORTED (Mode R).** Lock-in fires at ~2% of stream vs CR at ~20% (**~10× earlier**). CR's AUC (0.996) remains the broadest detector; lock-in's contribution is causal earliness, not ranking.
- **H-C (deployability):** A causal router recovers offline routing gain. **SCOPED.** At tight causal caps (0.05–0.15) causal-internal beats causal-CR; at loose caps CR wins; neither dominates → deployable design is the union.

**Two hallucination modes discovered:** Mode R (repetition-driven, 11/26 catastrophic tracks) vs Mode N (non-repetition, 15/26). This explains why no single reference-free detector can catch all hallucinations — each mode requires a different detection strategy.

**Module:** `src/causal_hallucination_probe.py` + `tests/test_causal_hallucination_probe.py` (23 unit tests).

### Research Thread 3: ASR × LLM × Emotion × Speaker (Issues #815–#842, PRs #816–#842)

**Grand RQ:** _Can a local, offline LLM and cheap reference-free signals jointly decide when to separate, when to repair, how to read emotion, and whether to trust speaker attribution — without any ground-truth reference?_

This thread unifies two project directions (ASR×LLM synergy + emotion) across 7 emotion-frontier experiments + 5 ASR×LLM experiments + 1 capstone synthesis.

**Design choices and justification:**

- **Why deepseek-r1:7b via ollama?** We required an LLM that: (a) runs fully offline (no API calls, no data leakage — critical for a research project on sensitive debate audio); (b) has reasoning capability (chain-of-thought) for emotion interpretation and minimal-edit repair; (c) is small enough (7B) for reproducible local experimentation. Alternatives considered: GPT-4/Claude (online, not reproducible, privacy concern); Llama-3-8B (no reasoning traces); Qwen-2.5-7B (comparable but less documented for Chinese). deepseek-r1:7b was already cached locally and had the best documented Chinese reasoning performance at this size.
- **Why Whisper-tiny for emotion experiments?** The emotion experiments needed the _same_ ASR outputs as the separation-tax baseline for cross-study comparability. Since Thread 1 established that the separation tax is tiny-specific, using tiny here means the emotion findings are _conservative_ — they study emotion under worst-case ASR errors.
- **Why gain-invariant prosody for emotion?** Standard SER (Speech Emotion Recognition) models require labeled training data, which doesn't exist for our overlap-controlled debate corpus. Instead, we operationalize emotion as _gain-invariant acoustic prosody_ (arousal-side), using the clean source's own prosody as reference — mirroring how CER uses the verified transcript. This follows the dimensional emotion tradition (Russell, 1980; Scherer, 2005) rather than discrete emotion categories.

**Literature grounding:**

- GenSEC-LLM challenge (arXiv:2409.09785, 2024): Makes post-ASR emotion recognition a first-class LLM task — but on clean single-speaker corpora. _Nobody has asked whether ASR errors induced by overlap+separation distort the emotion an LLM reads._
- R3 (arXiv:2409.15551, 2024): Couples ASR error-correction with emotion recognition — but uses clean audio. Our controlled overlap×separation grid is the right instrument to test this coupling under realistic conditions.
- VoxEmo (arXiv:2603.08936, 2026): Benchmarks speech emotion recognition with speech LLMs — confirms that LLMs have weak prosody perception, motivating our tri-modal approach.

**Unified conclusion:** Cheap Whisper decoder signals are the deployable lever for routing; acoustic prosody handles "acoustic emotion"; the local LLM's true value is _covering implicit semantic emotion_, not providing free repair or attribution rules.

**Capstone:** `docs/frontier/asr_llm_emotion_capstone.md` — a one-page synthesis with deployable decision recipe.
**Hero figure:** `results/frontier/asr_llm_frontier_capstone.png` (all five results on one canvas).

### Research Thread 4: Research Entropy Audit — Meta-Research on Agentic Ceremony Collapse (Issues #785/#787, PRs #786/#788)

**RQ:** _When an autonomous agentic loop runs unsupervised on a research repo, does it keep producing substance or drift into self-referential ceremony?_

**Motivation.** A scan of `src/` revealed ~795 of 893 `*.py` files were ceremony-named (handoff/receipt/coordination/completion-summary). Independent content check: **0 of 795 contained real computation** (compute-import 3.5% vs 17% for substance; 0.11 vs 4.07 arithmetic ops/file). The git timeline shows a clean epidemic arc: birth (2026-06-02, 35 substance / 0 ceremony) → first collapse (06-07) → peak (+250 ceremony files on 06-12) → recovery (06-15 cleanup).

**Why this matters for research methodology.** This is not a code quality issue — it is a _research integrity_ issue. Ceremony files that compute nothing but claim "completion" create an illusion of progress that misleads both human reviewers and automated agents. The phenomenon is relevant to any project using LLM-based code generation for research.

**Approach:**

- Built `src/research_entropy_audit.py` — a two-signal classifier (filename pattern + content computation check) + git timeline visualization + bounded degeneration index. `make entropy-audit`.
- Built `scripts/harness/entropy_guard.py` — a stdlib-only _advisory_ guard wired into `make quality-predev` that warns (never blocks) when a change adds ceremony with no substance.
- **Cleaned 6,000+ ceremony files** (803 src/\*.py + 1,112 tests + ~4,360 result artifacts). Lean-rewrote `project_harness.py` from ~4,400 lines to genuine baseline smoke.
- **Result:** Entropy saturation 0.894 → 0.035; degeneration index 0.46 → 0.00; tests 3,304 → 825 all green; import-closure 0 violations.

**Module:** `src/research_entropy_audit.py` + `scripts/harness/entropy_guard.py` + `docs/frontier/agentic_research_entropy.md`.

### Research Thread 5: Engineering Harness (Issue #780, PR #781)

**Motivation.** The project needed infrastructure to enforce research discipline: critical code changes must include paired tests, results must be labeled by evidence level, and PRs must include structured impact summaries. We adapted `ref/code-tape`'s Harness to this Python repository.

**Design choices:**

- **Why not adopt code-tape's training-camp scoring/auto-merge?** Those mechanisms optimize for _throughput_ (maximize merged PRs), which directly contributed to the ceremony collapse documented in Thread 4. We adopted only the _quality_ pillars: git hooks, knowledge-base contract, SDD, TDD.
- **Why GitNexus for the knowledge base?** GitNexus provides a code knowledge graph with symbol-level impact analysis, enabling the `Contract Guard` CI check that verifies critical skeleton changes include paired tests. No comparable open-source tool provides this at the symbol level.

**Implementation (943 lines of harness code across 5 Python modules):**

1. **Git hooks** (`.githooks/{pre-commit,pre-push}`): POSIX shell, ~15 lines each. pre-commit runs fast test gate (`quality.py precommit`); pre-push runs GitNexus contract + full test gate (`quality.py prepush`). `SKIP_QUALITY_HOOKS=1` escape hatch for emergencies. `install_hooks.py` sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks` automatically.

2. **Contract rules engine** (`scripts/harness/contract_rules.py`, 424 lines): Classifies every file in the repo into one of 6 critical-skeleton categories:
   - `router-core` — routing/selection logic (e.g., `adaptive_router_v2.py`, `gate_selector.py`)
   - `evaluation-core` — CER/error metrics (e.g., `evaluate_cer.py`, `speaker_cer.py`)
   - `harness` — infrastructure code (`scripts/harness/*`, `.githooks/*`)
   - `references` — verified reference transcripts (`references/`)
   - `gold-results` — stable benchmark results (`results/gold/`)
   - `authority-docs` — documentation that other code depends on (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/project_state.md`, `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`)

   Changes to files in these categories **trigger the paired-test gate**: the diff must include a corresponding `tests/test_<module>*.py` or the contract fails. This is the mechanical TDD enforcement.

3. **Contract check** (`scripts/harness/contract_check.py`, 238 lines): Runs on every `git push` (pre-push hook). Compares the staged diff against the contract rules; reports violations as structured JSON; integrates with CI as `Contract Guard` (`.github/workflows/contract-guard.yml`). Also enforces structured impact summary in the PR body.

4. **Quality dispatcher** (`scripts/harness/quality.py`, 123 lines): Unified command surface — `quality.py {predev,precommit,prepush,ci,local}` — each running the appropriate subset of {entropy guard, fast tests, contract check, full tests, GitNexus index refresh}. `Makefile` exposes these as `make quality-{predev,precommit,prepush}`.

5. **Entropy guard** (`scripts/harness/entropy_guard.py`, 128 lines): Advisory (never blocking) pre-dev check that warns when a change adds ceremony with no substance. Uses the same two-signal classifier as `research_entropy_audit.py` (Thread 4). Integrated into `make quality-predev`.

6. **SDD (Specification-Driven Development):**
   - Authority-doc hierarchy: `CLAUDE.md` (operating charter) -> `docs/project_state.md` (findings register) -> `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` (contribution record) -> `docs/roadmap.md`.
   - ADR-001 (`docs/adr/ADR-001-harness-adoption.md`): Architecture Decision Record documenting why we adopted the Harness and what we deliberately excluded.
   - PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`): Every PR must include a structured GitNexus impact summary with risk level, critical skeleton changes, blast radius, and verification evidence.

7. **TDD enforcement:** The contract rules engine mechanically blocks `git push` if a critical-skeleton change lacks its paired test. 41 harness-specific contract tests (`scripts/harness/tests/`) cover the engine itself — classification accuracy, diff parsing, violation reporting, edge cases.

8. **repo-guard LLM code review** integration: Every PR receives automated review comments from a configured GitHub bot. The author must respond to every guard finding (fix or justify) before merge. This standardized the `issue -> PR -> repo-guard CR -> respond` loop across all 45+ PRs.

**Workflow documentation:** `docs/harness/` contains 5 specification files:
   - `README.md` — harness overview and quick-start
   - `knowledge_base_contract.md` — contract rules specification
   - `sdd.md` — Specification-Driven Development rules
   - `tdd.md` — Test-Driven Development enforcement rules
   - `workflow_spec.md` — the standardized PR review loop

**Verification:** Pre-push gate passes live — GitNexus index (26,296 nodes) + contract + full suite (3,253 tests OK at adoption time). The harness enabled the entire frontier research workflow: every one of the 40+ frontier PRs passed through this gate, and the contract prevented any critical-skeleton change from landing without paired tests.

### Stable Baseline Contributions

In addition to the frontier research threads, I contributed to the project's stable baseline:

- **CER evaluation** and **error analysis** infrastructure (insertion/deletion/substitution/repetition breakdown).
- **Adaptive Router v1/v2** — rule-based routing between mixed/separated/cleaned outputs.
- **Risk-Aware Selector** — risk-weighted final output selection.
- **Speaker-Aware CER** and **cpCER-lite** — speaker permutation-invariant evaluation metrics.
- **Compute-Aware Cascade** — tiered ASR escalation analysis (CER vs compute trade-off).
- **MeetEval/cpWER compatibility** bridge for standardized evaluation.
- **`project_harness`** coordination — baseline smoke test (18/18 core files, 5/5 gold cases).

---

### Summary of Research Contributions

Across ~45 merged PRs and 36 frontier result directories, my contributions follow a consistent research methodology:

1. **Pre-registered hypotheses with falsifiable success/kill criteria** — every frontier study declares what would falsify it before running experiments.
2. **Honest negative results as findings** — 8 of 15+ frontier studies produced clean negatives (LLM rescoring catastrophic, cascade too coarse, arousal doesn't predict difficulty, etc.). Each negative narrows the solution space and is documented with the same rigor as positives.
3. **Literature-grounded novelty claims** — the causal hallucination probe includes a 6-agent literature sweep with per-hypothesis novelty assessment; honest about what is established bedrock vs genuinely new.
4. **Design choice justification** — model selection (Whisper-tiny for visibility, base for validity), LLM selection (deepseek-r1 for offline/reasoning), signal selection (gain-invariant prosody for label-free emotion) each grounded in specific constraints.
5. **Evidence discipline** — all frontier results labeled `experimental/frontier`; gold tables and verified references never touched; synthetic/silver references clearly marked.
6. **Reproducibility** — every module has paired unit tests; injected fake-LLM/Whisper for CI; all results in committed CSVs with reproducible `python -m src.<module>` commands.

## 吴方舟/wfzark（23123986）

**Role:** Core technical contributor; route-selection problem framer; main
experimental pipeline owner; AudioDepth frontier explorer; team report and
research-visualization contributor.

吴方舟的贡献主线是把项目从"比较一个固定 ASR 输出"推进为一个系统问题：
**when should an overlap-aware ASR system separate speech, keep mixed audio, or
fall back to a safer route?** 这一 framing 贯穿主实验、风险选择、前沿探索和
最终报告，使项目围绕 route selection、claim boundary 和 evidence level
组织，而不是只报告单一 CER 表。

### 1. Mainline ASR pipeline and route-selection evidence

在稳定主线上，吴方舟组织并实现/协调了项目的核心实验路径：

- mixed Whisper baseline；
- separated speaker-track ASR；
- speaker transcript merging；
- duplicate-suppressed cleaned separated transcript；
- verified gold-reference workflow；
- CER evaluation and comparison tables；
- error-type analysis for insertion / deletion / substitution / repetition；
- adaptive router v1；
- feature-based router v2；
- router ablation；
- synthetic silver validation；
- held-out synthetic split interpretation；
- speaker-aware CER；
- cpCER-lite speaker permutation checks；
- risk-aware final selector。

这些工作建立了项目最核心的比较面：`mixed_whisper`、
`separated_whisper`、`separated_whisper_cleaned`、router v1/v2、
risk-aware selector 和 oracle-best 的关系。对应的系统性文档入口包括
[Current results summary](results/figures/curated/current_results_summary.md),
[Results Index](docs/results-index.md), and
[Implementation Status](docs/implementation-status.md).

### 2. Evidence discipline and claim-boundary cleanup

吴方舟持续维护项目的证据边界，区分：

- five-case gold benchmark；
- synthetic silver validation；
- held-out synthetic split；
- silver-plus / proxy / diagnostic references；
- sampled real-Whisper validation；
- optional integration scaffolds；
- frontier exploratory research。

这部分贡献体现在主文档、结果索引和最终报告中，尤其是
[REPORT.md](REPORT.md) 中的 evidence-level table、limitations、team
contribution synthesis，以及对"CER is evaluation-only, never a routing input"
的反复约束。该工作避免把 synthetic、frontier 或 roadmap-only 内容误写成
stable mainline claim。

### 3. AudioDepth frontier research

吴方舟提出并推进 AudioDepth 方向，把 overlapping speech 解释为
time-frequency occlusion，并借鉴 RGB-D / depth-style visual recognition 中
"depth is an additional view, not a replacement for RGB"的思想。AudioDepth
探索 pre-ASR acoustic maps 是否能在 Whisper 产生不稳定 transcript 前暴露
overlap risk，从而辅助 mixed / separated / cleaned / review 路由。

该方向包括：

- overlap as time-frequency occlusion；
- RGB-D / depth-style research motivation and citations；
- deployable mixed-only AudioDepth maps；
- analysis-only separated-track diagnostics；
- AudioDepth MVP；
- weak simple-CNN negative result；
- model zoo, handcrafted features, CNN-depth models, balanced depth models；
- hybrid late fusion with transcript instability；
- controlled route-sensitive benchmark；
- balanced benchmark v2；
- real Whisper validation and proxy-to-real gap analysis；
- Stage-1 acoustic gate；
- risk-guarded sweep；
- end-to-end safety audit；
- curated 3D / channel / route-space visualizations。

AudioDepth 始终被标为 Frontier Branch Only / Exploratory Research，不替代
mainline pipeline，也不作为 stable deployment claim。完整研究叙事见
[AudioDepth Router Exploratory Study](docs/frontier/audio-depth-router.md)。

### 4. Team report, documentation integration, and research figures

近期贡献中，吴方舟推动并整理了团队级 [REPORT.md](REPORT.md)，把原本分散的
主线实验、Mode B cascade、speaker-aware evaluation、MeetEval/cpWER、
speaker-profile diagnostics、LLM critic、AudioDepth、OpenClaw / harness
等内容整合成一份 team-level research report。该报告删除了低信息密度的
handoff / receipt / checklist / queue 流水账，并改为围绕 research
question、benchmark evidence、core results、boundary analysis、compute-aware
routing、frontier studies 和 limitations 展开。

同时，吴方舟补充了可复现的科研绘图脚本
[`scripts/report/make_report_figures.py`](scripts/report/make_report_figures.py)，
并生成报告级图表：

- route map；
- gold CER strategy comparison；
- separation boundary phase plane；
- compute-aware cascade 3D surface。

这些图表服务于报告表达，不引入新 benchmark claim；数值图读取 curated
result tables，概念图明确标注为 decision surface / visualization。

### 5. Contribution boundary

吴方舟的贡献重点是主 ASR 实验管线、route-selection framing、AudioDepth 前沿
研究、证据边界维护和最终报告整合。已知限制仍然存在：gold benchmark 很小，
synthetic / silver 证据不能替代 gold，real-meeting generalization 未完全证明，
Stage-2 fallback / review policy 仍需更多验证，AudioDepth 需要独立评审后才
能进入任何 stable mainline claim。

  （步长舍入）、`build_gold_points`（锚点映射 + separation_helps
  标记）、`build_silver_points`（manifest overlap ratio 读取）、
  `aggregate_trend_rows`（分箱聚合 + help_rate 计算）。
- `tests/test_separation_phase_diagram_write_outputs.py`（1 项测试）：
  smoke test 验证 `write_outputs()` 正确输出 CSV（含正确列名和
  行数据）、JSON（结构正确）、Markdown（含 `experimental/frontier`
  标签和 case 名称）、PNG（非空文件 ≥ 6 字节）。

全部 6 项测试通过。

### 3. 研究意义

该项目首次为 overlap-aware ASR 提供了"分离是否值得"的量化视图：
在低重叠场景分离有益（delta < 0），在高重叠场景分离可能有害
（delta > 0），为 Router 决策和级联策略提供了实验依据。

**Role:** Mode D: Evaluation System & Cross-Benchmark Analysis（评估系统与跨实验对齐）

**主要贡献：**

- 构建统一 evaluation adapter，使 mixed / separated / cleaned / router v2 / cascade outputs 能够在同一评估接口下进行对齐比较，减少不同 pipeline 在格式层面的不一致问题。
- 设计并实现跨 benchmark aggregation 流程，将 gold / synthetic / held-out 三类数据的评估结果统一标准化为可复用 evaluation schema，用于 REPORT.md 与可视化模块共享。
- 对 speaker-aware CER、cpCER-lite 以及 error-type breakdown（insertion / deletion / repetition）进行了结构化整理，使其可用于后续 routing 与 separation 分析。
- 协助建立 evaluation sanity check pipeline，用于检测不同 ASR 输出在 alignment、length drift 与 duplication ratio 上的一致性风险。
- 参与 early-stage evaluation robustness exploration，分析不同 ASR pipeline 在长文本与高重叠场景下的 stability drift。
- 对 router v2 与 rule-based baseline 的评估偏差进行了对照分析，支持 report 中"reference-free routing validity"的实验结论构建。
- 提供 evaluation-side evidence support，用于验证 cascade / learned router / separation phase analysis 的实验一致性。
