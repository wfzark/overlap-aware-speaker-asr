# Overlap-Aware Speaker ASR

## Project in One Sentence

This repository studies when speech separation helps or hurts multi-speaker ASR, and provides a documented research pipeline for adaptive routing, speaker-aware evaluation, and carefully labeled frontier experiments.

## What This Project Does

- Maintains a five-case gold benchmark for overlap-aware ASR evaluation.
- Compares mixed Whisper, separated speaker-track Whisper, and cleaned separated transcripts.
- Reports CER, error-type analysis, speaker CER, and cpCER-lite style speaker attribution checks.
- Provides adaptive router v1/v2 and a risk-aware selector for reference-free transcript choice.
- Includes compute-aware cascade analysis and Mode B cascade tiers as mainline experimental work.
- Keeps synthetic silver validation separate from gold benchmark claims.
- Provides optional scaffolding for MeetEval, LLM critic/repair, speaker-profile work, and demo support.
- Uses CI, tests, ADRs, and a harness workflow to protect the stable baseline.

## What This Project Does Not Claim

- It does not claim to train a new ASR foundation model.
- It does not claim to train a new speech separation model.
- It does not treat synthetic silver validation as gold benchmark evidence.
- It does not use ground-truth CER as a routing input.
- It does not treat frontier scaffolding, coordination records, receipts, or writebacks as stable mainline claims.
- It does not claim that `frontier/audio-depth-router` is ready to merge directly into `main`.

## Current Status

See [docs/implementation-status.md](docs/implementation-status.md) for the detailed status matrix.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Gold benchmark, Whisper baselines, CER/error/speaker-aware evaluation | Stable Mainline |
| Router v1/v2, risk-aware selector, compute-aware cascade | Mainline Experimental |
| Mode B / cascade tiers | Mainline Experimental |
| Synthetic validation | Mainline Experimental; silver evidence only |
| MeetEval, LLM, speaker-profile, demo support | Optional Integration / Frontier Scaffold |
| AudioDepth router | Frontier Branch Only |

## Quickstart

Use a Python version aligned with CI, preferably Python 3.12. The core install is:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.project_harness
```

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`, install the core requirements first; it is usually an environment setup issue, not evidence that the project code is broken.

Full setup, optional dependencies, smoke tests, demo setup, and troubleshooting are in [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Results

Start with [docs/results-index.md](docs/results-index.md) and [results/README.md](results/README.md).

Recommended result entry points:

- [Current results summary](results/figures/curated/current_results_summary.md)
- [Adaptive routing summary](results/figures/curated/best_method_by_case.md)
- [Risk-aware selector summary](results/figures/curated/risk_aware_selection_summary.md)
- [Compute-aware cascade summary](results/figures/curated/compute_aware_cascade_summary.md)
- [Mode B cascade tiers summary](results/figures/curated/cascade_tiers_summary.md)

Historical wave, receipt, writeback, checklist, and demo presentation records have been moved under `results/figures/archive/`. They are useful for traceability, but they are not final benchmark claims.

## Mainline vs Frontier

- `main` is the stable review baseline.
- `frontier/audio-depth-router` is a high-risk experimental branch with many artifacts and model-like outputs; it needs separate review and should be split before any merge.
- `wave*`, `frontier/wave*`, and `demo-wave*` branches are mostly historical coordination/writeback trails.
- `improve/*` and `cursor/*` branches with no diff against `main` are cleanup candidates, but this pass does not delete remote branches.

See [docs/branch-audit.md](docs/branch-audit.md) for the branch cleanup policy.

## Frontier Research: AudioDepth Router

AudioDepth is an exploratory frontier research line that treats overlapping
speech as a time-frequency occlusion problem, inspired by depth-style
representations in visual recognition. It studies whether pre-ASR acoustic maps
can help decide when to use mixed ASR, separated ASR, cleaned routes, or
review/fallback paths.

See [AudioDepth Router Exploratory Study](docs/frontier/audio-depth-router.md)
for the research motivation, visualization design, experiment stages,
controlled results, limitations, and merge boundaries.

AudioDepth is not currently a stable mainline claim and should not be merged
from `frontier/audio-depth-router` without separating code, documentation,
lightweight examples, tests, and large artifacts.

## Harness Engineering Loop

> Developed with reference to [code-tape](https://github.com/ceilf6/code-tape).

An always-on development harness keeps the stable baseline safe while frontier work continues. It has four pillars (full docs in [`docs/harness/`](docs/harness/README.md)):

- **Git hooks** — `pre-commit` runs the fast test gate and `pre-push` runs the contract + full test gate, installed via `core.hooksPath`. Bootstrap once with `make agent-bootstrap`.
- **Knowledge base** — GitNexus indexes the code graph so a change's cascade is visible before editing critical modules ([contract](docs/harness/knowledge_base_contract.md)).
- **SDD** — an authority-document hierarchy plus [ADRs](docs/adr/README.md) anchor what agents treat as ground truth ([spec](docs/harness/sdd.md)).
- **TDD** — the contract mechanically requires a paired test for every critical code change, red → green → refactor ([spec](docs/harness/tdd.md)).

The full loop is `issue → PR → repo-guard CR → respond` ([workflow](docs/harness/workflow_spec.md)). code-tape's engineering-camp scoring and auto-merge automation is intentionally out of scope.

## OpenClaw: Agentic Engineering Assistant

> Illustrative tooling shown for context, not a benchmark result. Label: `qualitative/demo`.

OpenClaw ("ceilf6's claw") is the agentic engineering assistant that drives
the kind of workflow described in the Harness Engineering Loop above. Instead
of living only in a terminal, it runs as chat 智能体 (agents) inside the IM tools
a team already uses — 飞书 (Feishu) and 大象 — so issue triage, code review, and
progress reporting happen in the conversation rather than in a separate
dashboard.

It exposes named agents driven by slash commands:

- **`FrontAgent`** — reference-free code review that returns a risk summary
  (Blocker / Critical counts plus concrete fixes, e.g. flagging a
  dynamic-`RegExp` ReDoS in a test file) and `/progress-reporter` group updates
  that track each member's current issue, unclaimed work, recently merged PRs,
  and milestones.
- **坤坤** — a conversational agent for handover notes, material organization, and message polishing.

Agents call LLM backends (e.g. `gpt-5.5`) through a provider abstraction and
follow the same `issue → PR → repo-guard CR → respond` loop documented above.
OpenClaw is developed alongside [code-tape](https://github.com/ceilf6/code-tape).
