# When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech

We study when speech separation helps or hurts multi-speaker ASR, and we build adaptive routing, risk-aware evaluation, and agent-friendly research infrastructure for speaker-attributed transcription.

## What This Project Is

- ASR pipeline optimization
- adaptive routing
- error type analysis
- speaker-aware evaluation
- synthetic robustness validation
- risk-aware selection
- agentic research workspace

## What This Project Is Not

- not training a new ASR model
- not training a new speech separation model
- not claiming synthetic silver results as gold
- not using ground-truth CER as router input

## Main Results

### Gold Benchmark Averages

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| fixed_mixed_whisper | 0.302093 |
| fixed_separated_whisper | 0.191846 |
| fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned | 0.181681 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Synthetic Validation

| setting | v1 | v2 | oracle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| original 25 | 0.350902 | 0.167553 | 0.082239 |
| held-out split test | 0.361350 | 0.335326 | 0.115181 |

### Risk-Aware Selector

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| risk_aware_selector | 0.134587 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Experimental Compute-aware Cascade

| strategy | average CER | relative cost vs fixed separated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| router_v2_costed | 0.120042 | 0.929533 |
| risk_aware_costed | 0.134587 | 0.929533 |
| budget_cascade | 0.134587 | 0.929533 |

This result is labeled `experimental/frontier`. It uses observed runtime fields when available and proxy costs otherwise; CER is used only after each route is fixed.

Current runtime provenance audit result:

- gold cascade strategies: `5/5` observed runtime selections for every reported strategy
- proxy cost is currently a safety fallback, not an active source for the committed gold cascade tables

### Synthetic Split Cascade Validation

| strategy | average CER | relative cost vs fixed separated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| router_v2_synthetic_costed | 0.285187 | 0.704888 |
| budget_cascade | 0.367582 | 0.854921 |
| cleaned_preferred_cascade | 0.249877 | 0.945686 |

This result is labeled `synthetic/silver` plus `experimental/frontier`. It extends the cascade analysis onto the held-out synthetic split benchmark without promoting silver evidence into gold claims.

Current runtime provenance audit result:

- synthetic split cascade strategies: `100/100` observed runtime selections on `ALL`, and `50/50` on both `DEV` and `TEST`
- proxy cost remains available for missing-runtime edge cases, but it is not currently driving the committed synthetic split cascade outputs

Current runtime normalization audit result:

- gold `router_v2_costed / risk_aware_costed / budget_cascade`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.080646`
- synthetic split `router_v2_synthetic_costed`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.148342`
- synthetic split `budget_cascade`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.148228`
- this `RTF` is normalized by the selected route's processed audio duration, so separated routes divide by two-stream duration rather than one mixed-stream duration

Current Pareto frontier audit result:

- gold `ALL` frontier: `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `router_v2_costed`
- gold `risk_aware_costed` and `budget_cascade` are dominated by `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic split `ALL` frontier: `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, `cleaned_preferred_cascade`
- synthetic split `budget_cascade` is dominated by `router_v2_synthetic_costed`

Current recommendation card result:

- gold `ALL`
  - `accuracy_first`: `router_v2_costed`
  - `cost_first`: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
  - `balanced`: `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic split `ALL`
  - `accuracy_first`: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`
  - `cost_first`: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
  - `balanced`: `router_v2_synthetic_costed`

## Project Map

The repository now has a stable baseline and a breadth-first frontier queue. The diagram below shows the main flow at a glance.

    G --> J["Speaker profile / voiceprint"]
    G --> K["LLM critic / repair"]
    G --> L["Demo excellence"]
```

The current breadth-first queue is documented here:

- [Frontier execution queue](results/figures/frontier_execution_queue.md)
- [Project harness report](results/figures/project_harness_report.md)

Queue order:

1. `meeteval_compatibility`
2. `external_validation`
3. `speaker_profile`
4. `llm_critic`
5. `demo_excellence`

These are coordination targets, not new benchmark claims.

Current robustness gap result:

- best shared cross-dataset stability: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` with `cer_gap_vs_gold = -0.00266`
- strongest adaptive shared route: `router_v2` with `cer_gap_vs_gold = 0.165145`
- `budget_cascade` degrades more on synthetic split, with `cer_gap_vs_gold = 0.232995`

Current recommendation stability result:

- `cost_first` is fully stable across the audited scopes with `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `balanced` has `consensus_ratio = 0.75`, splitting between `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed`
- `accuracy_first` also has `consensus_ratio = 0.75`, splitting between `router_v2_costed` and `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`

Current family-level recommendation stability result:

- after normalizing `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` into the same family, `balanced` rises to `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `cost_first` remains fully stable at `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `accuracy_first` still splits between `router_v2` and `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`

Current decision matrix result:

- `accuracy_first`: gold points to `router_v2_costed`, synthetic `ALL` points to `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, and the shared robustness rank is `1`
- `balanced`: points to the `router_v2` family with `family_consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `cost_first`: stays on `fixed_mixed_whisper` with `family_consensus_ratio = 1.0`, but carries the weakest synthetic `ALL` CER among the three profiles

Current frontier execution queue status result:

- `results/figures/frontier_execution_queue_status.md`
- `results/tables/frontier_execution_queue_status.csv`
- The unified queue status now uses the same five-track frontier surface as the top-level go/no-go board, so `combined_chain_status` only becomes ready when `meeteval_compatibility`, `speaker_profile`, `external_validation`, `llm_critic`, and `demo_excellence` are all in their narrow execution-ready states.

Current MeetEval readiness result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_readiness.md` now turns that compatibility bridge into a narrow dry-run handoff card
- This still does not claim MeetEval or cpWER execution: it records that the export is ready for a diagnostic follow-up while also surfacing that cleaned fallback remains common in the current bridge

Current MeetEval dry run handoff result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_handoff.md` now turns that readiness card into a one-row execution handoff packet
- This remains strictly pre-evaluation coordination: it recommends a single verified-case dry run, records the cleaned-fallback blocker, and names the expected evidence writeback without claiming that MeetEval or cpWER has already been run

Current MeetEval dry run receipt result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_receipt.md` now materializes that expected evidence target as a template-only receipt
- This still does not claim execution: it defines the intended run scope, expected inputs, and post-run writeback note so the first diagnostic dry run has an explicit evidence slot before anyone fills it

- `results/figures/meeteval_dry_run_diagnostic.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_dry_run_diagnostic.csv`
- The first narrow diagnostic pass on `NoOverlap` validated the export path and updated the receipt to `diagnostic_complete` without claiming cpWER evaluation.

Current MeetEval cpWER bridge result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_bridge.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_bridge.csv`
- The all-gold cpWER bridge-lite pass reports `average_cpwer_bridge_lite = 0.120823` with `direct_mapping_count = 5/5`. This is `experimental/frontier` evidence, not a full MeetEval benchmark claim.

Current MeetEval cpWER bridge summary result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_bridge_summary.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_bridge_summary.csv`
- The summary condenses the five verified gold cases without promoting bridge-lite evidence into a finished MeetEval evaluation claim.

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_alignment.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_alignment.csv`
- Cross-metric alignment reports `matched_count = 4/5` with `HeavyOverlap` as the only drift case against speaker_macro_cer.

Current MeetEval cpWER bridge handoff result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_bridge_handoff.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_bridge_handoff.csv`
- This handoff turns the bridge-lite result into the next narrow frontier step while keeping full MeetEval evaluation explicitly pending.

Current MeetEval cpWER tokenization gain scorecard result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard.csv`
- The scorecard shows `5/5` gold cases with positive raw-to-character adaptation gain and aligned character-level scores against bridge-lite, supporting `character_spaced` as the default MeetEval mode for this CJK gold benchmark family.

Current MeetEval cpWER tokenization gain summary result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard_summary.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard_summary.csv`
- The summary reports `average_raw_to_character_gain = 3.679091`, `max_gain_case = NoOverlap`, and keeps the conclusion explicitly in `experimental/frontier` scope rather than claiming a finished benchmark.

Current MeetEval cpWER tokenization gain scorecard bridge checklist result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard_bridge_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard_bridge_checklist.csv`

- `results/tables/meeteval_cpwer_tokenization_gain_scorecard_handoff.csv`
- `handoff_status = tokenization_gain_handoff_ready` at `5/5` adapted-and-aligned cases; adaptation completion remains coordination-only.

Current speaker profile result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_risk_summary.md` now provides a lightweight text-profile overlap report that compares direct vs swapped alignment and currently exposes a useful failure mode rather than a speaker-ID success claim

Current speaker profile triage result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_triage.md` now compresses that per-case signal into one aggregate failure-summary card
- This triage view still does not claim voiceprint success: it currently records `5/5` `swapped_bias` across the gold cases and recommends trying a stronger profile method before treating attribution as useful

Current speaker profile method handoff result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_method_handoff.md` now turns that triage card into a one-row stronger-method handoff packet
- This remains diagnostic rather than celebratory: it recommends an `embedding_or_voiceprint_baseline` direction and names the expected evidence target without claiming that any stronger profile method has already worked

Current speaker profile method receipt result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_method_receipt.md` now materializes that expected evidence target as a template-only receipt
- This still does not claim any improved attribution: it defines the method scope, expected inputs, expected outputs, and writeback note so the first stronger-method trial has a concrete receipt to fill

Current speaker profile method bridge checklist result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_method_bridge_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_method_bridge_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the method handoff into an ordered bridge verification path. It stays coordination-only and keeps the handoff and receipt targets visible without claiming any stronger speaker-profile method has been executed.

Current speaker profile embedding scaffold result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_embedding_scaffold.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_embedding_scaffold.json`
- The stronger-method scaffold is `scaffold_only` and points toward `embedding_or_voiceprint_baseline` without claiming improved speaker attribution.

Current speaker profile audio proxy result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_audio_proxy_trial.md`
- `results/figures/speaker_profile_audio_proxy_summary.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_audio_proxy_trial.csv`
- This first real audio-side proxy trial stays explicitly `experimental/frontier`: it reproduces the earlier `swapped_bias` pattern, but with an average confidence gap of only `0.000013`, so the current lightweight acoustic profile does not yet justify attribution claims.

Current speaker profile go-no-go board result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_go_no_go_board.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_go_no_go_board.csv`
- The board shows the current `NoOverlap` path is ready for a narrow embedding-baseline execution flow, while still blocking any broader speaker-attribution claim.

Current speaker profile go-no-go summary result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_go_no_go_summary.md`
- `results/tables/speaker_profile_go_no_go_summary.csv`
- The summary records `overall_state = narrow_execution_ready` together with `primary_boundary = attribution_claims_still_blocked_by_weak_support`, so the next action stays deliberately narrow.

Current speaker profile go-no-go board bridge checklist result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_qualitative_note.md` now provides a qualitative/demo critic bridge that turns structured risk cues into critique, repair direction, and uncertainty notes without claiming verified transcript correction

Current llm critic review queue result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_queue.md` now turns that qualitative critic bridge into a lightweight review order
- This queue is still `qualitative/demo` rather than a verified repair loop: it recommends which case to read first and currently surfaces the widespread swapped-profile uncertainty as a failure-mode signal rather than a solved correction pipeline

Current llm critic review receipt result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_receipt.md` now materializes the expected evidence slot for that first review pass
- This still does not claim any successful repair: it defines the review scope, expected inputs, expected outputs, and writeback note so the first critic-style pass has a concrete receipt to fill

Current llm critic review pass result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_pass.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_review_pass.csv`
- The first qualitative pass on `HeavyOverlap` is `review_complete` without any verified transcript repair claim.

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_checklist.md` now turns the review queue into an ordered execution checklist
- This checklist remains `qualitative/demo`: it helps a future contributor pick the first critic-style pass and keeps the receipt target explicit without claiming any verified repair

Current llm critic go-no-go board result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_go_no_go_board.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_go_no_go_board.csv`
- The board shows the qualitative critic chain is largely ready for a narrow writeback path, while still blocking any verified repair claim.

Current llm critic go-no-go summary result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_go_no_go_summary.md`
- `results/tables/llm_critic_go_no_go_summary.csv`
- The summary records `overall_state = qualitative_writeback_ready` together with `primary_boundary = verified_repair_claims_still_blocked`, so any next step must stay explicitly qualitative/demo.

- `results/figures/external_validation_candidates.md` now provides an `external/sanity-check` candidate card across AISHELL-4, AliMeeting, AMI, and LibriCSS with source note, license note, fit note, first preprocessing step, and next action
- This note does not claim that an external benchmark has already been run; it only makes the first dataset triage step explicit

Current external validation prioritization result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_prioritization.md` now adds a lightweight prioritization card that recommends `AISHELL-4` as the first tiny external sanity-check target
- This note stays scoped to `external/sanity-check` planning: it records priority tier, recommended order, readiness note, and why-now context without claiming that any external dataset has already been evaluated

Current external validation slice handoff result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_handoff.md` now turns that prioritization into a single first-slice handoff packet
- This remains strictly pre-execution coordination: it names the first slice shape, license gate, mapping artifact, and dry-run goal without claiming that any external benchmark has already been staged or run

Current external validation slice receipt result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_receipt.md` now materializes the expected evidence target for that first external slice
- This still does not claim any external execution: it defines the template-only writeback slot, expected inputs, and expected outputs so a future narrow dry run has a concrete receipt to fill

Current external validation slice scaffold result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_scaffold.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_slice_mapping.json`
- The first AISHELL-4 mapping stub is `scaffold_only` with `license_status = pending_confirmation`. No external audio or benchmark evaluation has been run yet.

Current external validation license gate result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_license_gate.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_license_gate.csv`
- The license gate checklist documents preflight steps while `license_status` remains `pending_confirmation` and external audio staging stays blocked.

Current external validation slice manifest result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_manifest.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_slice_manifest.json`
- The slice manifest records `staging_status = blocked_by_license_gate` for the first AISHELL-4 excerpt.

Current external validation slice bridge checklist result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_slice_bridge_checklist.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_slice_bridge_checklist.csv`
- This checklist now turns the first external slice handoff into an ordered bridge verification path. It stays `external/sanity-check` and keeps the handoff and receipt targets visible without claiming any external execution.

Current external validation checklist result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_checklist.md` now turns the prioritized candidates into an execution checklist so the next contributor can walk the external sanity-check path in order
- This stays labeled `external/sanity-check`: it sequences the preflight steps and still does not claim that any external validation run has been completed

Current external validation go-no-go board result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_go_no_go_board.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_go_no_go_board.csv`
- The board shows `5/5` checkpoints still at `no_go` for the first AISHELL-4 slice and makes `license_confirmation_pending` the explicit top blocker before any staging attempt.

Current external validation go-no-go summary result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_go_no_go_summary.md`
- `results/tables/external_validation_go_no_go_summary.csv`
- The summary collapses the chain into `overall_state = blocked_by_license_confirmation`, keeping the conclusion in `external/sanity-check` scope rather than implying that any external benchmark has been run.

Current external validation skill result:

- `docs/skills/skill_07_external_validation.md` now provides a dedicated skill card for the external mini-validation frontier
- The frontier is therefore directly pickable from the skills index as well as from the roadmap and project-state layers

Current Streamlit demo scaffold:

- `demo/app.py` provides a lightweight qualitative/demo viewer with tabs for storyboard cards, walkthrough steps, gold benchmark averages, and frontier fill queue status
- Install demo dependencies with `pip install -r requirements-demo.txt`, then run `streamlit run demo/app.py`

Current demo walkthrough result:

- `results/figures/demo_walkthrough.md` now provides a short ordered talk track for presenting the repository in five steps
- This walkthrough is still `qualitative/demo` presentation support rather than a new experiment result: it anchors each step to an existing artifact so a future demo or recording can stay consistent with the current evidence

Current demo walkthrough receipt result:

- `results/figures/demo_walkthrough_receipt.md` now materializes the expected evidence slot for that first walkthrough pass
- This still does not claim a completed live demo or recording: it defines the walkthrough scope, expected inputs, expected outputs, and writeback note so the first presentation pass has a concrete receipt to fill

- `results/tables/demo_go_no_go_summary.csv`
- The summary records `overall_state = presentation_writeback_ready` together with `primary_boundary = live_demo_claims_still_blocked`, so any next step must stay explicitly in qualitative/demo scope.

## Core Findings

- Speech separation is useful, but not universally beneficial.
- `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
- `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
- `cpCER-lite` did not find speaker swap as the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
- Feature-based router v2 is more stable than overlap-only v1 on synthetic validation.
- The risk-aware selector is an explainability and deployability layer, not the best-CER result.
- The repository is now also framed as an open-ended agentic research workspace for ambitious extensions.

## Beyond the Baseline: Open Challenge Directions

- Separation Phase Diagram
- Compute-aware Cascaded Recognition
- Speaker Profile / Voiceprint Risk Detection
- Agentic LLM Transcript Critic
- External Mini Validation
- GitHub Demo Excellence

The stable baseline is complete, but this repository is designed as an open-ended agentic research playground. Future contributors are encouraged to attempt ambitious extensions while keeping gold/silver/experimental results clearly separated.

Additional maintenance docs:

- [Contribution records](docs/contributions/)
- [Handoff notes](docs/handoff/)
- [Backup plan](docs/backup_plan.md)

If you are continuing the project, read the docs above first, then inspect the current results, and only then decide whether a new experiment is justified.

## Notes

- The repository keeps verified references for all five benchmark cases.
- `LLM` and `RAG` are now integrated as a collaborative repair loop (see below).
- The current research focus is adaptive routing, error analysis, speaker-aware evaluation, stability checking, and ambitious frontier exploration.


## LLM-ASR Collaborative Repair

### Architecture

```
ASR Output → Risk Detection → RAG Retrieval → LLM Repair → CER Evaluation
     ↑                                                           |
     └──────────────── Iterate if improved ──────────────────────┘
```

### Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `src/llm_repair_loop.py` | Iterative LLM transcript correction, convergence detection (max 3 rounds), offline/online dual mode |
| `src/rag_repair.py` | RAG retrieval using verified reference segments as knowledge base, character n-gram Jaccard similarity |
| `src/router_feature_importance.py` | Per-feature contribution analysis for Router v2 + bar chart visualization |

### Usage

```bash
# Offline baseline (no API key, oracle method selection)
python -m src.llm_repair_loop --offline

# Online LLM repair (set OPENAI_API_KEY or LLM_API_KEY)
python -m src.llm_repair_loop --model deepseek-chat

# Disable RAG
python -m src.llm_repair_loop --model deepseek-chat --no-rag

# RAG retrieval demo
python -m src.rag_repair

# Router feature importance
python -m src.router_feature_importance
```

### RAG Integration

- **Knowledge Base**: `references/reference_transcripts.json` verified gold segments
- **Retrieval**: Character 3-gram Jaccard similarity (replaceable with embedding-based)
- **Context Injection**: Top-3 retrieved segments → LLM prompt

### Design Rationale

1. **Iterative**: Max 3 rounds, CER evaluated each round, only improvements accepted
2. **Risk-Aware**: Prioritizes cases flagged by risk-aware selector
3. **Conservative**: Rolls back to previous best if CER degrades
4. **Offline Fallback**: Oracle baseline available without API key

### Expected Results

| Strategy | Avg CER (Gold) |
| --- | ---: |
| Router v2 (no repair) | 0.120 |
| + Offline Oracle | ~0.100 |
| + LLM Repair (with RAG) | TBD |
