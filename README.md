# When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech

We study when speech separation helps or hurts multi-speaker ASR, and we build adaptive routing, risk-aware evaluation, and agent-friendly research infrastructure for speaker-attributed transcription.

## What This Project Is

- ASR pipeline optimization
- adaptive routing
- error type analysis
- speaker-aware evaluation
- synthetic robustness validation
- risk-aware selection
- agentic research workspace

## What This Project Is Not

- not training a new ASR model
- not training a new speech separation model
- not claiming synthetic silver results as gold
- not using ground-truth CER as router input

## Main Results

### Gold Benchmark Averages

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| fixed_mixed_whisper | 0.302093 |
| fixed_separated_whisper | 0.191846 |
| fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned | 0.181681 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Synthetic Validation

| setting | v1 | v2 | oracle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| original 25 | 0.350902 | 0.167553 | 0.082239 |
| held-out split test | 0.361350 | 0.335326 | 0.115181 |

### Risk-Aware Selector

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| risk_aware_selector | 0.134587 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

## Core Findings

- Speech separation is useful, but not universally beneficial.
- `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
- `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
- `cpCER-lite` did not find speaker swap as the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
- Feature-based router v2 is more stable than overlap-only v1 on synthetic validation.
- The risk-aware selector is an explainability and deployability layer, not the best-CER result.
- The repository is now also framed as an open-ended agentic research workspace for ambitious extensions.

## Beyond the Baseline: Open Challenge Directions

- Separation Phase Diagram
- Compute-aware Cascaded Recognition
- Speaker Profile / Voiceprint Risk Detection
- Agentic LLM Transcript Critic
- External Mini Validation
- GitHub Demo Excellence

The stable baseline is complete, but this repository is designed as an open-ended agentic research playground. Future contributors are encouraged to attempt ambitious extensions while keeping gold/silver/experimental results clearly separated.

## Project Maintenance and Future Skills

The skill cards are not model-training prompts. They are challenge cards for future work:

- [Skill 02: Compute-aware Cascaded Recognition](docs/skills/skill_02_compute_aware_cascade.md)

Additional maintenance docs:

If you are continuing the project, read the docs above first, then inspect the current results, and only then decide whether a new experiment is justified.

## Notes

- The repository keeps verified references for all five benchmark cases.
- `LLM` and `RAG` are future extensions rather than the core quantitative path.
- The current research focus is adaptive routing, error analysis, speaker-aware evaluation, stability checking, and ambitious frontier exploration.
