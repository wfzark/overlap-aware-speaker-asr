# When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech

We study when speech separation helps or hurts multi-speaker ASR, and we build adaptive routing, risk-aware evaluation, and agent-friendly research infrastructure for speaker-attributed transcription.

## What This Project Is

- ASR pipeline optimization
- adaptive routing
- error type analysis
- speaker-aware evaluation
- synthetic robustness validation
- risk-aware selection
- agentic research workspace

## What This Project Is Not

- not training a new ASR model
- not training a new speech separation model
- not claiming synthetic silver results as gold
- not using ground-truth CER as router input

## Main Results

### Gold Benchmark Averages

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| fixed_mixed_whisper | 0.302093 |
| fixed_separated_whisper | 0.191846 |
| fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned | 0.181681 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Synthetic Validation

| setting | v1 | v2 | oracle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| original 25 | 0.350902 | 0.167553 | 0.082239 |
| held-out split test | 0.361350 | 0.335326 | 0.115181 |

### Risk-Aware Selector

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| risk_aware_selector | 0.134587 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Experimental Compute-aware Cascade

| strategy | average CER | relative cost vs fixed separated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| router_v2_costed | 0.120042 | 0.929533 |
| risk_aware_costed | 0.134587 | 0.929533 |
| budget_cascade | 0.134587 | 0.929533 |

This result is labeled `experimental/frontier`. It uses observed runtime fields when available and proxy costs otherwise; CER is used only after each route is fixed.

Current runtime provenance audit result:

- gold cascade strategies: `5/5` observed runtime selections for every reported strategy
- proxy cost is currently a safety fallback, not an active source for the committed gold cascade tables

### Synthetic Split Cascade Validation

| strategy | average CER | relative cost vs fixed separated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| router_v2_synthetic_costed | 0.285187 | 0.704888 |
| budget_cascade | 0.367582 | 0.854921 |
| cleaned_preferred_cascade | 0.249877 | 0.945686 |

This result is labeled `synthetic/silver` plus `experimental/frontier`. It extends the cascade analysis onto the held-out synthetic split benchmark without promoting silver evidence into gold claims.

Current runtime provenance audit result:

- synthetic split cascade strategies: `100/100` observed runtime selections on `ALL`, and `50/50` on both `DEV` and `TEST`
- proxy cost remains available for missing-runtime edge cases, but it is not currently driving the committed synthetic split cascade outputs

Current runtime normalization audit result:

- gold `router_v2_costed / risk_aware_costed / budget_cascade`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.080646`
- synthetic split `router_v2_synthetic_costed`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.148342`
- synthetic split `budget_cascade`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.148228`
- this `RTF` is normalized by the selected route's processed audio duration, so separated routes divide by two-stream duration rather than one mixed-stream duration

Current Pareto frontier audit result:

- gold `ALL` frontier: `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `router_v2_costed`
- gold `risk_aware_costed` and `budget_cascade` are dominated by `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic split `ALL` frontier: `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, `cleaned_preferred_cascade`
- synthetic split `budget_cascade` is dominated by `router_v2_synthetic_costed`

Current recommendation card result:

- gold `ALL`
  - `accuracy_first`: `router_v2_costed`
  - `cost_first`: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
  - `balanced`: `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic split `ALL`
  - `accuracy_first`: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`
  - `cost_first`: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
  - `balanced`: `router_v2_synthetic_costed`

Current robustness gap result:

- best shared cross-dataset stability: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` with `cer_gap_vs_gold = -0.00266`
- strongest adaptive shared route: `router_v2` with `cer_gap_vs_gold = 0.165145`
- `budget_cascade` degrades more on synthetic split, with `cer_gap_vs_gold = 0.232995`

Current recommendation stability result:

- `cost_first` is fully stable across the audited scopes with `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `balanced` has `consensus_ratio = 0.75`, splitting between `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed`
- `accuracy_first` also has `consensus_ratio = 0.75`, splitting between `router_v2_costed` and `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`

Current family-level recommendation stability result:

- after normalizing `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` into the same family, `balanced` rises to `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `cost_first` remains fully stable at `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `accuracy_first` still splits between `router_v2` and `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`

Current decision matrix result:

- `accuracy_first`: gold points to `router_v2_costed`, synthetic `ALL` points to `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, and the shared robustness rank is `1`
- `balanced`: points to the `router_v2` family with `family_consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `cost_first`: stays on `fixed_mixed_whisper` with `family_consensus_ratio = 1.0`, but carries the weakest synthetic `ALL` CER among the three profiles

Current frontier report result:

- `results/figures/cascade_frontier_report.md` now consolidates the decision matrix, family stability, and robustness highlights in one generated note

Current artifact index result:

- `results/figures/cascade_artifact_index.md` now acts as the registry for the cascade evidence stack, with per-artifact labels, generator commands, and intended usage notes

Current benchmark readiness result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_readiness.md` now prioritizes which cascade artifacts should be refreshed first once controlled hardware/runtime evidence replaces the current repo-local timing signals

Current benchmark plan result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_plan.md` now turns that readiness ordering into a staged handoff plan with dataset scope, command, and refresh targets

Current profile playbook result:

- `results/figures/cascade_profile_playbook.md` now translates `accuracy_first / balanced / cost_first` into a concise deployment-facing guide for when to use each profile

Current benchmark checklist result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_checklist.md` now records which hardware/runtime metadata and acceptance checks should be captured for each benchmark phase

Current benchmark manifest template result:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_manifest_template.csv` now provides a fill-in template for recording per-phase benchmark session metadata during controlled timing runs

Current benchmark status result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_status.md` now acts as a phase-by-phase status board that shows which benchmark steps are still template-only, how many fields remain open, which blocker category each phase is in, and what next action should happen first

Current benchmark execution summary result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_summary.md` now provides the phase-level blocker totals, readiness rollup, and top next action before reading the per-step status board

Current benchmark execution queue result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_execution_queue.md` now provides the ordered next-run list so contributors can see what to execute or review first

Current benchmark session ledger result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_session_ledger.md` now provides the evidence anchor and completion note for each queued benchmark step

Current benchmark dependency graph result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_dependency_graph.md` now shows which benchmark step unlocks each downstream benchmark refresh

Current benchmark blocker matrix result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_blocker_matrix.md` now shows blocker type, queue priority, dependency state, and pending-field scale in one place

Current benchmark runbook card result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_runbook_card.md` now gives the first-step action, required evidence, and completion target as a one-page execution card

Current benchmark milestone card result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_milestone_card.md` now shows the next milestone, what the first step unlocks, and how many phases remain

Current benchmark phase checkpoint card result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_phase_checkpoint_card.md` now shows each phase's blocker, next action, and completion signal in one short card

Current benchmark completion dashboard result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_completion_dashboard.md` now shows the current start step, dominant blocker family, and pending phase count in one short dashboard

Current benchmark operator brief result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_operator_brief.md` now gives the current benchmark operator a plain-language next step, evidence target, and urgency note

Current benchmark evidence receipt result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_evidence_receipt.md` now shows what the current benchmark run must write back, which completion signal closes it, and what follow-up note should remain

Current benchmark handoff packet result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_handoff_packet.md` now acts as the single-entry benchmark handoff note across readiness, plan, checklist, manifest template, execution summary, execution queue, session ledger, dependency graph, blocker matrix, runbook card, milestone card, phase checkpoint card, completion dashboard, operator brief, evidence receipt, and status tracking

Current frontier harness breadth result:

- `results/figures/project_harness_report.md` now includes a `frontier_status` table so contributors can see the current breadth-first status of `speaker_profile`, `meeteval_compatibility`, `llm_critic`, `external_validation`, and `demo_excellence`

Current MeetEval compatibility result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_compatibility_note.md` now provides a segment-level compatibility bridge across verified gold references and speaker-attributed hypotheses without claiming a finished cpWER evaluation

Current MeetEval readiness result:

- `results/figures/meeteval_readiness.md` now turns that compatibility bridge into a narrow dry-run handoff card
- This still does not claim MeetEval or cpWER execution: it records that the export is ready for a diagnostic follow-up while also surfacing that cleaned fallback remains common in the current bridge

Current speaker profile result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_risk_summary.md` now provides a lightweight text-profile overlap report that compares direct vs swapped alignment and currently exposes a useful failure mode rather than a speaker-ID success claim

Current speaker profile triage result:

- `results/figures/speaker_profile_triage.md` now compresses that per-case signal into one aggregate failure-summary card
- This triage view still does not claim voiceprint success: it currently records `5/5` `swapped_bias` across the gold cases and recommends trying a stronger profile method before treating attribution as useful

Current llm critic result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_qualitative_note.md` now provides a qualitative/demo critic bridge that turns structured risk cues into critique, repair direction, and uncertainty notes without claiming verified transcript correction

Current llm critic review queue result:

- `results/figures/llm_critic_review_queue.md` now turns that qualitative critic bridge into a lightweight review order
- This queue is still `qualitative/demo` rather than a verified repair loop: it recommends which case to read first and currently surfaces the widespread swapped-profile uncertainty as a failure-mode signal rather than a solved correction pipeline

Current external validation candidate result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_candidates.md` now provides an `external/sanity-check` candidate card across AISHELL-4, AliMeeting, AMI, and LibriCSS with source note, license note, fit note, first preprocessing step, and next action
- This note does not claim that an external benchmark has already been run; it only makes the first dataset triage step explicit

Current external validation prioritization result:

- `results/figures/external_validation_prioritization.md` now adds a lightweight prioritization card that recommends `AISHELL-4` as the first tiny external sanity-check target
- This note stays scoped to `external/sanity-check` planning: it records priority tier, recommended order, readiness note, and why-now context without claiming that any external dataset has already been evaluated

Current demo storyboard result:

- `results/figures/demo_storyboard.md` now provides a one-page demo-facing story that explains the problem, pipeline, findings, and current frontier extensions with a lightweight Mermaid diagram

Current demo walkthrough result:

- `results/figures/demo_walkthrough.md` now provides a short ordered talk track for presenting the repository in five steps
- This walkthrough is still `qualitative/demo` presentation support rather than a new experiment result: it anchors each step to an existing artifact so a future demo or recording can stay consistent with the current evidence

## Core Findings

- Speech separation is useful, but not universally beneficial.
- `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
- `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
- `cpCER-lite` did not find speaker swap as the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
- Feature-based router v2 is more stable than overlap-only v1 on synthetic validation.
- The risk-aware selector is an explainability and deployability layer, not the best-CER result.
- The repository is now also framed as an open-ended agentic research workspace for ambitious extensions.

## Beyond the Baseline: Open Challenge Directions

- Separation Phase Diagram
- Compute-aware Cascaded Recognition
- Speaker Profile / Voiceprint Risk Detection
- Agentic LLM Transcript Critic
- External Mini Validation
- GitHub Demo Excellence

The stable baseline is complete, but this repository is designed as an open-ended agentic research playground. Future contributors are encouraged to attempt ambitious extensions while keeping gold/silver/experimental results clearly separated.

If you are continuing the project, read the docs above first, then inspect the current results, and only then decide whether a new experiment is justified.

## Notes

- The repository keeps verified references for all five benchmark cases.
- `LLM` and `RAG` are future extensions rather than the core quantitative path.
- The current research focus is adaptive routing, error analysis, speaker-aware evaluation, stability checking, and ambitious frontier exploration.
