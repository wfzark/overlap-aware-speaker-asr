# When Should We Separate? Boundary-aware, Compute-aware, Speaker-aware, and Agent-augmented ASR for Overlapping Speech

We study when speech separation helps or hurts multi-speaker ASR, and we build adaptive routing, risk-aware evaluation, and agent-friendly research infrastructure for speaker-attributed transcription.

## What This Project Is

- ASR pipeline optimization
- adaptive routing
- error type analysis
- speaker-aware evaluation
- synthetic robustness validation
- risk-aware selection
- agentic research workspace

## What This Project Is Not

- not training a new ASR model
- not training a new speech separation model
- not claiming synthetic silver results as gold
- not using ground-truth CER as router input

## Main Results

### Gold Benchmark Averages

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| fixed_mixed_whisper | 0.302093 |
| fixed_separated_whisper | 0.191846 |
| fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned | 0.181681 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Synthetic Validation

| setting | v1 | v2 | oracle |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| original 25 | 0.350902 | 0.167553 | 0.082239 |
| held-out split test | 0.361350 | 0.335326 | 0.115181 |

### Risk-Aware Selector

| strategy | average CER |
| --- | ---: |
| risk_aware_selector | 0.134587 |
| router_v2 | 0.120042 |
| oracle_best | 0.120042 |

### Experimental Compute-aware Cascade

| strategy | average CER | relative cost vs fixed separated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| router_v2_costed | 0.120042 | 0.929533 |
| risk_aware_costed | 0.134587 | 0.929533 |
| budget_cascade | 0.134587 | 0.929533 |

This result is labeled `experimental/frontier`. It uses observed runtime fields when available and proxy costs otherwise; CER is used only after each route is fixed.

Current runtime provenance audit result:

- gold cascade strategies: `5/5` observed runtime selections for every reported strategy
- proxy cost is currently a safety fallback, not an active source for the committed gold cascade tables

### Synthetic Split Cascade Validation

| strategy | average CER | relative cost vs fixed separated |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| router_v2_synthetic_costed | 0.285187 | 0.704888 |
| budget_cascade | 0.367582 | 0.854921 |
| cleaned_preferred_cascade | 0.249877 | 0.945686 |

This result is labeled `synthetic/silver` plus `experimental/frontier`. It extends the cascade analysis onto the held-out synthetic split benchmark without promoting silver evidence into gold claims.

Current runtime provenance audit result:

- synthetic split cascade strategies: `100/100` observed runtime selections on `ALL`, and `50/50` on both `DEV` and `TEST`
- proxy cost remains available for missing-runtime edge cases, but it is not currently driving the committed synthetic split cascade outputs

Current runtime normalization audit result:

- gold `router_v2_costed / risk_aware_costed / budget_cascade`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.080646`
- synthetic split `router_v2_synthetic_costed`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.148342`
- synthetic split `budget_cascade`: average selected-route `RTF = 0.148228`
- this `RTF` is normalized by the selected route's processed audio duration, so separated routes divide by two-stream duration rather than one mixed-stream duration

Current Pareto frontier audit result:

- gold `ALL` frontier: `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `router_v2_costed`
- gold `risk_aware_costed` and `budget_cascade` are dominated by `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic split `ALL` frontier: `fixed_mixed_whisper`, `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, `router_v2_synthetic_costed`, `cleaned_preferred_cascade`
- synthetic split `budget_cascade` is dominated by `router_v2_synthetic_costed`

Current recommendation card result:

- gold `ALL`
  - `accuracy_first`: `router_v2_costed`
  - `cost_first`: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
  - `balanced`: `router_v2_costed`
- synthetic split `ALL`
  - `accuracy_first`: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`
  - `cost_first`: `fixed_mixed_whisper`
  - `balanced`: `router_v2_synthetic_costed`

Current robustness gap result:

- best shared cross-dataset stability: `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned` with `cer_gap_vs_gold = -0.00266`
- strongest adaptive shared route: `router_v2` with `cer_gap_vs_gold = 0.165145`
- `budget_cascade` degrades more on synthetic split, with `cer_gap_vs_gold = 0.232995`

Current recommendation stability result:

- `cost_first` is fully stable across the audited scopes with `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `balanced` has `consensus_ratio = 0.75`, splitting between `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed`
- `accuracy_first` also has `consensus_ratio = 0.75`, splitting between `router_v2_costed` and `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`

Current family-level recommendation stability result:

- after normalizing `router_v2_costed` and `router_v2_synthetic_costed` into the same family, `balanced` rises to `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `cost_first` remains fully stable at `consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `accuracy_first` still splits between `router_v2` and `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`

Current decision matrix result:

- `accuracy_first`: gold points to `router_v2_costed`, synthetic `ALL` points to `fixed_separated_whisper_cleaned`, and the shared robustness rank is `1`
- `balanced`: points to the `router_v2` family with `family_consensus_ratio = 1.0`
- `cost_first`: stays on `fixed_mixed_whisper` with `family_consensus_ratio = 1.0`, but carries the weakest synthetic `ALL` CER among the three profiles

Current frontier report result:

- `results/figures/cascade_frontier_report.md` now consolidates the decision matrix, family stability, and robustness highlights in one generated note

Current artifact index result:

- `results/figures/cascade_artifact_index.md` now acts as the registry for the cascade evidence stack, with per-artifact labels, generator commands, and intended usage notes

Current benchmark readiness result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_readiness.md` now prioritizes which cascade artifacts should be refreshed first once controlled hardware/runtime evidence replaces the current repo-local timing signals

Current benchmark plan result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_plan.md` now turns that readiness ordering into a staged handoff plan with dataset scope, command, and refresh targets

Current profile playbook result:

- `results/figures/cascade_profile_playbook.md` now translates `accuracy_first / balanced / cost_first` into a concise deployment-facing guide for when to use each profile

Current benchmark checklist result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_checklist.md` now records which hardware/runtime metadata and acceptance checks should be captured for each benchmark phase

Current benchmark manifest template result:

- `results/tables/cascade_benchmark_manifest_template.csv` now provides a fill-in template for recording per-phase benchmark session metadata during controlled timing runs

Current benchmark status result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_status.md` now acts as a phase-by-phase status board that shows which benchmark steps are still template-only, how many fields remain open, which blocker category each phase is in, and what next action should happen first

Current benchmark handoff packet result:

- `results/figures/cascade_benchmark_handoff_packet.md` now acts as the single-entry benchmark handoff note across readiness, plan, checklist, manifest template, and status tracking

## Core Findings

- Speech separation is useful, but not universally beneficial.
- `NoOverlap`, `HeavyOverlap`, and `OppositeOverlap` benefit strongly from separated speaker-track ASR.
- `LightOverlap` and `MidOverlap` degradation is mainly caused by insertion and repetition hallucination.
- `cpCER-lite` did not find speaker swap as the dominant error source in the five gold cases.
- Feature-based router v2 is more stable than overlap-only v1 on synthetic validation.
- The risk-aware selector is an explainability and deployability layer, not the best-CER result.
- The repository is now also framed as an open-ended agentic research workspace for ambitious extensions.

## Beyond the Baseline: Open Challenge Directions

- Separation Phase Diagram
- Compute-aware Cascaded Recognition
- Speaker Profile / Voiceprint Risk Detection
- Agentic LLM Transcript Critic
- External Mini Validation
- GitHub Demo Excellence

The stable baseline is complete, but this repository is designed as an open-ended agentic research playground. Future contributors are encouraged to attempt ambitious extensions while keeping gold/silver/experimental results clearly separated.

If you are continuing the project, read the docs above first, then inspect the current results, and only then decide whether a new experiment is justified.

## Notes

- The repository keeps verified references for all five benchmark cases.
- `LLM` and `RAG` are future extensions rather than the core quantitative path.
- The current research focus is adaptive routing, error analysis, speaker-aware evaluation, stability checking, and ambitious frontier exploration.
